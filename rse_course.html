<u>Clarity-Driven Development of Scientific Software Workshop</u>
<br>
<h1>From Intent to Implementation</h1>

<p>You have an idea. You know your research project involves a lot of coding. But how do you go from a broad thesis topic to something you can actually build, test, and deliver?</p>
<p>This course is for master's and PhD students who want to avoid the all-too-common trap: jumping into coding without fully understanding the objective, what success looks like, or how their solution should be structured. Because this often results in messy, pieced-together scripts that are hard to maintain, adapt, and reuse. Or worse: weeks wasted solving the wrong problem.</p>
<p>In this two-day workshop, you'll learn the principles of <strong>Clarity-Driven Development (CDD)</strong>—a practical framework to navigate the why, what, and how of software design. Through a mix of short sessions, guided exercises, and peer feedback, you'll define your goals, sketch your results, and outline a clean, modular implementation tailored to your research—so you can stay focused, iterate faster, and avoid getting stuck in dead ends.</p>

<h3>This workshop is for you if...</h3>
<ul>
<li>You're in the early stages of your thesis and want to get organized before diving into the implementation.</li>
<li>You're looking for a lightweight process to align your research purpose, evaluation results, and code design.</li>
<li>You're stuck, second-guessing yourself, or unsure what to prioritize next.</li>
<li>You'd benefit from structured time to step back, reflect, and think critically about what you're developing and why.</li>
<li>You value peer exchange and want feedback not just on your technical approach, but on how you're framing the whole project.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Key Course Outcomes</h5>
<p>By the end of the workshop, you'll know how to translate your research intent into a concrete implementation, supported by intuitive visualizations of your expected results and the clarity to code with confidence.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>To get the most out of the course, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your thesis topic and have started some initial research</li>
<li>Already have some basic programming experience (preferably, but not necessarily, in Python)</li>
<li>Be fluent in English (all materials are in English; the sessions may be held in German if all participants agree)</li>
</ul>

<p>The workshop is designed to integrate with your thesis work—not add extra overhead. The activities help you clarify and plan what you're already expected to deliver.</p>

<h2>Workshop Agenda</h2>
<p>The two-day course is based on my book <a target="_blank" href="./rsebook/index.html">Clarity-Driven Development of Scientific Software</a> and combines structured input, self-guided work, and collaborative discussions.</p>
<p>The workshop takes place <strong>remotely</strong> via Zoom, Google Meet, or similar. Please join the calls with your <strong>camera turned on</strong> so the sessions feel more personal.</p>

<h2>Optional: Individual Coaching Sessions</h2>
<p>After the workshop, you have the option to book additional <strong>individual coaching sessions</strong> with me for continued support during your implementation phase.<br>
These follow-up sessions are ideal if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're programming (primarily) in <strong>Python</strong></li>
<li>You want detailed feedback on your code</li>
<li>You think regular check-ins could help you stay on track and make steady progress</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ul class="checkboxes">
<li><input type="checkbox"> Read Part 2 of the book: <a target="_blank" href="./rsebook/part2.html" rel="nofollow">"Writing Code"</a></li>
<li><input type="checkbox"> Set up your repository and host it on GitHub or GitLab and send me a link (if it's public) or invite me so I can see the code</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Coaching Sessions</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the first session, we review the plan for your implementation and define how we want to work together</li>
<li>For the following sessions, you send me your changes in advance (preferably as a merge request) and in the session we discuss the feedback and next steps</li>
</ul>
