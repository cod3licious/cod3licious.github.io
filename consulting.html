<p>Your data - may that be information about your customers, sensor measurements from the machines on your assembly line, images, or text documents - is like a rough diamond: treated with the right tools, it will be invaluable!</p>

<!-- <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135420305494">predictive maintenance</a> -->
<p>Successfully utilizing this data, for example, to gain new insights about customer churn, monitor your machines with a predictive maintenance approach, or automate boring and error-prone processes, requires two things: <em>a deep understanding of the problem and data</em> at hand, as well as the intimate <em>knowledge of a wide array of machine learning algorithms</em>, ranging from basic data analysis tools to natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning methods. Luckily, the first part is already taken care of, as you are an expert in your domain. And I am here to help you choose, apply, and evaluate the right machine learning models to transform your data into value.</p>

<p>I'd be happy to support you at all stages of the data science workflow:
<img src="./assets/data_science_workflow.gif" alt="data science workflow step by step" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>define the scope of your problem and outline how ML and AI can help you solve it</li>
  <li>implement and evaluate different ML algorithms to analyze your data and/or</li>
  <li>advise on and discuss potential solutions with the data scientists in your team</li>
  <li>support you in deploying a production-ready machine learning solution</li>
</ul>

<p>I prefer to work in an agile manner with short iterations and in close collaboration with the data owners in your team to ensure that the machine learning solution fits all your needs and generalizes well even to potentially novel settings encountered in your day-to-day operations. Furthermore, I believe that a sustainable AI strategy for any company includes setting up its own data science team, which is why my overarching objective is to help you build this team and get it to a point where you don't need my services anymore.</p>

<h3>AI Transformation of a Company</h3>
<p>Dr. Andrew Ng, professor for machine learning at Stanford University and co-founder of Google Brain, has proposed a <a href="https://landing.ai/ai-transformation-playbook/" target="_blank">five-step process</a> to transform a company into a data-driven enterprise capable of using AI in production to add value:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with small <strong>pilot projects</strong> to understand the potential and challenges of using ML</li>
<li>Set up a centralized <strong>AI team</strong> and data infrastructure to carry out bigger projects efficiently &amp; effectively</li>
<li>
<strong>Train other employees</strong> to recognize ML problems &amp; establish a data-driven culture</li>
<li>Devise a cohesive <strong>AI &amp; data strategy</strong> with long-term goals that result in a competitive advantage</li>
<li>
<strong>Communicate</strong> your success</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd be happy to support you in this process, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>assess project ideas for their feasibility &amp; help with their implementation to ensure your first experiments with machine learning are a success</li>
<li>provide structured trainings and individual coaching sessions for employees that want to grow into a data scientist role (&rarr; Workshop: ML for Data Scientists)</li>
<li>help with hiring capable data scientists (e.g., draft compelling job listings that ask for meaningful qualifications instead of random buzzwords, screen CVs, and conduct technical interviews)</li>
<li>provide broad AI training for other employees (&rarr; Workshop: ML for Data Strategists)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Individual Coaching Sessions</h3>
<p>The individual coaching sessions are targeted primarily towards scientists and engineers that are experts in their domain, but received only little (if any) formal training in software development or Python and/or are newcomers to the field of machine learning. <br> In these sessions</p>
<ul>
<li>we discuss the problem and your goal and brainstorm possible solutions,</li>
<li>you get tips for the implementation and feedback on your existing (Python) code,</li>
<li>and if you want, I can even code particularly tricky functions for you (e.g., a novel neural network architecture tailored to your use case).</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of these sessions is for you or your team to get regular feedback and new impulses for solving day-to-day challenges.</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="./resources.html">resources</a> page to get a head start, e.g., if you want to extend your methodological toolbox and learn how machine learning algorithms can be used to solve complex problems with structured or unstructured data.</p>

<h3>Technical Project Management</h3>
<p>In addition to advising your team on how to solve specific technical challenges, I'd also be happy to get more involved in the overall development of new (digital, data-driven) products, i.e.,</p>
<ul>
<li>understand the goals and needs of you, your users, and other stakeholders and translate these into product requirements <!-- (&rarr; why? what? how?) --></li>
<li>devise a conceptual product design that fulfills the requirements, with a clear structure and <strong>information architecture</strong> that is intuitive to understand, and provides a cohesive, coherent, and consistent user experience</li>
<li>work together with designers and developers to make your vision a reality, following an agile methodology with frequent updates about milestones</li>
<li>with more than a decade of programming experience under my belt, I make sure the product not only has a clean structure and intuitive interface, but is also implemented with a solid <strong>software architecture</strong> in an efficient and easily maintainable way to ensure that any future updates or changes can be implemented without any headaches</li>
</ul>
