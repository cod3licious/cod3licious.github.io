<h2>resources</h2>
<p>Below you can find some resources to improve your machine learning and Python knowledge.</p>

<h3>Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>My free online book <a href="./mlbook/index.html" target="_blank">"A Practitioner's Guide to Machine Learning"</a></li>
    <li>The associated programming <a href="https://github.com/cod3licious/ml_exercises" target="_blank">exercises</a> &amp; <a href="./mlws_resources/cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">cheat sheet</a></li>
    <li>A <a href="./mlws_resources/exercise_your_ml_project.pdf" target="_blank">ML project worksheet</a> to sketch out a new project idea</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to learn more about ML, you can also participate in one of my workshops:</p>

For more information &amp; workshop agenda:
<ul>
    <li><a href="./mlws_executive.html">ML for Executives</a></li>
    <li><a href="./mlws_strategist.html">ML for Data Strategists</a></li>
    <li><a href="./mlws_scientist.html">ML for Data Scientists</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Python programming</h3>
<ul>
<li>My <a href="https://github.com/cod3licious/python_tutorial" target="_blank">Python tutorial</a>, where you can learn the basics needed for data analysis and scientific computing in Python</li>
</ul>
<p>Also highly recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://aspp.school/wiki/" target="_blank">Advanced Scientific Programming in Python</a> summer school, to learn more about advanced topics like version control, testing, parallelization, etc. (materials from past sessions are available online for free!)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://pydata.org/" target="_blank">PyData</a> conferences and meetups (with past talks on their YouTube channel), to stay up-to-date on the development of cool new libraries and hear about other peoples' use cases &amp; their lessons learned</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to programming in general, a process that works well for me is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Understand the problem &amp; develop a plan:</strong> Turn off your computer, take out pen and paper and sketch the solution: What steps does it take to solve the problem? How can they be subdivided into reusable functional units? How do the individual components work together? What are their inputs and outputs? What data structures could simplify things?</li>
<li>
<strong>Write documentation and comments:</strong> Once you've developed a plan for how to solve your problem, turn your computer back on and open your code editor of choice. Start with the main function and write comments for all the steps that need to be executed to solve your problem. If one step should be moved to a separate utility function, write the skeleton of the function and its docstring describing what the function does and what its inputs and return values are. For these utility functions you can either add comments describing the individual steps now or when you start coding the main function before you dive into the subroutines.</li>
<li>
<strong>Code:</strong> After you've sketched out all the steps, start with the actual coding, i.e., fill your comment skeleton with life. While coding, in addition to the comments outlining the high-level steps for solving the problem, it often also makes sense to document any unusual design choices. For example, if you couldn't implement something in a straightforward way, because your data is messy in some places and this would cause an error, explain this in a comment, otherwise someone will later wonder why this was done this way instead of the more efficient solution and might end up wasting time rediscovering your initial problems. Furthermore, comments are very helpful to remind yourself about things that need to be changed in the future, e.g., "<code># TODO: once the data collection pipeline has been fixed, this code can be simplified to ...</code>".</li>
<li>
<strong>Refactoring:</strong> Check your whole program again: Could your code be improved somewhere? For example, do you have code blocks that are copy &amp; pasted and could be put into a separate function to avoid later having to change the same code in multiple places? Does any one function seem particularly long and would it make sense to move pieces of it to a separate function?</li>
</ol>
<p>By first being clear about what you want to accomplish and sketching out the steps in the comments, your code will have a much cleaner structure and you ensure that it contains all the necessary comments for someone else to understand what you were trying to do here (where this someone else may often be you two weeks later - trust me, you'll thank your past self later ;-)).</p>
