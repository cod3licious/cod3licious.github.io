<h1>Exercise: Your next ML project</h1>

<p>Machine learning can help you in various ways by generating insights from large amounts of (possibly unstructured) data, improving decision making and planning processes by providing predictions about future events, or automating tedious tasks otherwise requiring human experts.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you should come up with a problem that you would want to see solved by ML, evaluate how well ML could actually solve this problem, and provide first steps towards the solution.</p>
<p>Preferably, this project idea should be related to your current job and may also be a project that you were already planning to work on soon (but no past/completed projects please).</p>

<p>You can use <a target="_blank" href="./mlws_resources/exercise_your_ml_project_template.pptx" rel="nofollow"><strong>this template</strong></a> to prepare your slides and should aim for a <strong>5 minute presentation</strong>.</p>

<p>You can find the slides for some example projects below as well as a more detailed description of what to write for each point <a href="./mlws_resources/ml_project_considerations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>In case you need some inspiration for a project idea, have a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.climatechange.ai/summaries" rel="nofollow">how ML could be used to fight climate change</a>.</p>

<h4>ML problem checklist:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is there a <a target="_blank" href="./mlbook/_when_should_you_use_ml.html">simpler solution</a> (i.e., without using ML)?<br>
&#8594; Use ML to learn <em>unknown, complex</em> rules from data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can it be solved with an <a target="_blank" href="./mlbook/_ml_solutions_overview.html">existing ML algorithm</a>?<br>
&#8594; Possibly break the input-output problem down into simpler steps with known solutions instead of spending years on research<br>
<u>Please note:</u> <strong>Only well established ML algorithms are listed</strong> in the slide template. If your problem requires a different solution, feel free to change one of the answers to a different algorithm category, but you should then probably also add as an additional <strong>risk</strong> that it might be difficult to solve this problem with ML. If you have trouble determining the correct ML approach for your idea, the book section <a target="_blank" href="./mlbook/_taxonomy_of_ml_problems_solutions.html" rel="nofollow">"Taxonomy of ML problems &amp; solutions"</a> might help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have <a target="_blank" href="./mlbook/_garbage_in_garbage_out.html">enough high-quality data</a> available?<br>
&#8594; ML models need the right inputs and learn best from unambiguous targets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the solution give you a <a target="_blank" href="./mlbook/_ai_transformation_of_a_company.html">strategic advantage</a>?<br>
&#8594; Should you <u>build</u> it yourself or can you <u>buy</u> it?<br>
&#8594; Can you create synergies between departments that work with similar data?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example project ideas:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>[<a target="_blank" href="./mlws_resources/example_projects/production_process.pdf" rel="nofollow">pdf</a>] A manufacturing company wants to improve their production process by automatically recognizing faulty products, understanding why products become defective, and automatically choosing better production settings.</p></li>
<li><p>[<a target="_blank" href="./mlws_resources/example_projects/eshop_recsys.pdf" rel="nofollow">pdf</a>] A hardware store wants to extend their online shop with product recommendations.</p></li>
<li><p>[<a target="_blank" href="./mlws_resources/example_projects/customer_segmentation.pdf" rel="nofollow">pdf</a>] The marketing department of a company wants to better understand their customers so they can improve their marketing campaigns by targeting individual customer groups more selectively.</p></li>
<li><p>[<a target="_blank" href="./mlws_resources/example_projects/image_classification.pdf" rel="nofollow">pdf</a>] A manufacturer of medical imaging machines wants to offer a new feature to automatically highlight problematic areas in the picture that indicate a certain disease.</p></li>
