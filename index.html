<p><em>I mentor R&D teams through the full machine learning lifecycle—from tailored models to sustainable production systems.</em></p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>

<div>R&D teams often have strong domain knowledge but face recurring issues when working on data science projects:
<ul>
  <li>Promising models stall as prototypes and never make it into production.</li>
  <li>Codebases accumulate technical debt, slowing development and blocking progress.</li>
  <li>Project goals and architectural design are unclear, leading to wasted effort and rework.</li>
  <li>MLOps practices are missing, so even working models can't be sustained over time.</li>
</ul>
As a result, valuable ideas often fail to deliver real-world impact.
</div>

<h3>A Better Way</h3>

<p>I help your team avoid these pitfalls by combining deep <strong>machine learning expertise with software engineering and MLOps best practices</strong>.<br>
My approach delivers concrete results while ensuring long-term sustainability:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dive into your data and domain to understand the problem in depth.</li>
  <li>Experiment with tailored ML models and demonstrate feasibility through proofs of concept.</li>
  <li>Pair with your team to refine prototypes into clean, maintainable code.</li>
  <li>Build robust data pipelines, and set up monitoring and retraining workflows.</li>
  <li>Optimize architecture and eliminate technical debt so the team stays unblocked.</li>
  <li>Mentor developers so they gain the skills to own and maintain solutions after I'm gone.</li>
</ul>

<p>The outcome: projects move beyond prototypes to provide lasting impact while your team gains valuable skills.</p>

<br><hr>
<h3>What I Offer</h3>

<p>I work with teams in a flexible, hands-on way—providing immediate value while setting them up for long-term success.</p>

<h4>Core Offering: Long-Term Mentorship</h4>

<p>The main way I work is by joining your team part-time (around 20h/week for 6–12 months). I support projects end-to-end: from early experimentation through production deployment and beyond. Along the way, I level up your team through code reviews, architectural guidance, and hands-on help where needed.</p>

<h4>Entry Packages</h4>

<div>To start working together, I offer two short, focused engagements. These provide immediate results and let us test whether a longer collaboration is the right fit.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use Case & Concept Workshop</strong> (1-2 weeks)<br>For teams beginning a new ML or data-driven project. We define the use case, clarify scope and requirements, and design a solid architecture from the start. The outcome is a shared plan that avoids wasted effort and sets the foundation for clean, production-ready development.</li>
  <li><strong>ML Systems Audit & Roadmap</strong> (2-4 weeks)<br>For teams with prototypes that haven't made it into production. I review your codebase, data pipelines, and ML workflows to identify weaknesses in architecture, code quality, and maintainability. You receive a clear roadmap for refactoring and strengthening the system so it can scale reliably into production.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Why Me</h3>

<ul>
  <li>PhD in machine learning with strong expertise in Python, data science, and scientific computing.</li>
  <li>Years of experience in the process industry and manufacturing, giving me insight into the challenges of applying ML in real-world industrial and R&D contexts.</li>
  <li>Track record of helping teams take ML projects from messy prototypes to production systems with impact.</li>
  <li>Deep knowledge of both ML algorithms and modern software engineering, MLOps, and architecture best practices.</li>
  <li>Focus on mentoring: your team remains the owner of the solution and grows self-sufficient.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ready to Work Together?</h3>

<p>Whether your team is starting a new ML project or struggling to move a prototype into production, I can help you deliver results that last.
