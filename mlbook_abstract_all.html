<p><strong>Why read this book?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a lot of machine learning (ML) resources out there. Many of them either targeted at students or researchers and rather heavy on the mathematical theory, or others in the form of tutorials, focusing on the concrete implementation and application of some ML algorithm to a specific problem. This book tries to find a middle ground between both the theoretical background, which I have studied in depth while completing my PhD in machine learning at the TU Berlin, Germany, and the practical applications of these algorithms to solve different problems, as I have been doing in the last few years as an independent data science consultant for various firms. This book originated from my experience holding dozens of machine learning seminars and workshops in front of audiences with varying levels of technical and mathematical background.</p>

<p><strong>Questions this book answers:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which problems can machine learning (ML) solve?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does ML solve these problems, i.e., how do the algorithms work (in theory)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you actually get this to work in practice and avoid common pitfalls?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book does <strong>not</strong> explain the latest fancy neural network model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on some specific task. Instead it provides a general intuition for the ideas behind different machine learning algorithms to establish a solid framework that helps you better understand and integrate into a bigger picture what you later read about these specific approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book and the associated courses exist in two versions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the full version, targeted at (about to be) data scientists: [<a href="https://franziskahorn.de/mlbook/">book</a>][<a href="https://franziskahorn.de/mlws_scientist.html">course</a>]</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The condensed version is written for all audiences, i.e., readers generally interested in ML, who want to understand what is behind the hype and where ML can&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or should not&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;be used. The full version is mainly written for ML practitioners and assumes the reader is familiar with elementary concepts of linear algebra (see also this <a href="https://franziskahorn.de/mlws_resources/math_basics.pdf" target="\_blank">overview on the mathematical notation</a> used in the book).</p>

<p>Machine learning is already used all around us to make our lives more convenient:</p>

<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Face recognition</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Face recognition technology is one of the earliest notable examples of machine learning and computer vision that can nowadays be found in every digital camera and smartphone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the algorithms implemented in a camera application are fairly simple and only detect the presence of faces in general to make sure you look your best when the picture is taken, more sophisticated algorithms are also being used by governments and law enforcement in more and more countries to match a detected face to a known person in their biometric databases, for example, to identify criminals. So&#8230;&#8203;smile!?</p>

<p><strong>Object recognition (e.g., for self-driving cars)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another example from the area of computer vision is object recognition or image segmentation in general. This is, for example, used in self-driving cars to make sure they are aware of street signs and pedestrians.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Analysis of medical images</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last example on image data comes from the application area of medicine: Below you see two images of retinas, i.e., photos taken of the back of someone&#8217;s eye, based on which it is possible to diagnose a common complication of diabetes that can result in blindness if left untreated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diagnostic algorithm to identify the markers of the disease in these images was developed by researchers at Google and achieves the same level of accuracy as human experts in the field. Google had even assembled a team of top specialists to discuss the hardest cases again to get consistent labels for all images, which gave their model an additional performance boost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the equipment to take these images is fairly cheap, this means that with this ML model, expert diagnostic decisions can now be made available to those that might otherwise not have had the means to consult a top specialist.</p>

<p><strong>Conversational agents (i.e., speech recognition&#8230;&#8203;)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leaving the field of computer vision, now an example from the area of natural language processing (NLP): Conversational agents, like Siri or Alexa, are waiting for commands in many people&#8217;s homes. While many of the answers they give are still scripted by humans (as in the screenshot below), the real challenge is to understand what the person had actually said in the first place. Speech recognition, i.e., automatically transcribing spoken language into text, is a rather difficult problem, for example, since people speak with different accents and there can be additional background noises.</p>

<p><strong>Machine translation</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again from the field of NLP: machine translation, i.e., automatically translating text from one language into another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have used Google Translate (shown as an example in the screenshot below) after it was first released in 2006, you were probably often quite disappointed with the results, as the translated sentences read more like the words were just looked up one after another in a dictionary (= statistical machine translation). However, this changed when Google made the switch to a neural network model to generate the translations 10 years later in 2016: now the translated texts are actually readable and usually require only minor manual corrections, if any.</p>

<p><strong>Recommender systems</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another application area are recommender systems, for example, on e-commerce platforms (like Amazon in the screenshot below) to provide the user with helpful search results and suggestions, and thereby generate revenue for the respective companies. They are also used on social media platforms and by Netflix, YouTube &amp; co to keep you glued to your screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes the provided suggestions might help you find exactly what you were looking for. But especially platforms with uncurated content such as YouTube have also been criticized for fostering, e.g., conspiracy theories through these personalized recommendations. Since this kind of content kept users especially engaged, it was recommended a lot and thereby drove the users further down some rabbit hole instead of also providing perspectives outside one&#8217;s own information bubble.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But on the upside, the research on recommender systems has also sparked developments in other areas of science, such as methods that recommend drug molecules that fit to the proteins playing a key role in certain diseases to accelerate the search for a cure.</p>

<p><strong>Protein folding - solving a 50-year-old challenge</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DeepMind presented another major success story in 2020: Their AlphaFold model now estimates the 3D structure of a protein from its raw amino acid sequence as accurately as traditional simulation models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proteins often play a key role in diseases. If we know a protein&#8217;s 3D structure, we can determine which drug molecules can bind to it and thereby identify target structures that should be investigated further to find a cure for the disease.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While exact simulation models to estimate a protein&#8217;s 3D structure existed for a long time, these were very slow and it often took several days to compute the folding for a single protein. With the new neural network model, the same computation can now be done in a matter of minutes or even seconds, thereby vastly accelerating drug development.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why is there such a rise in ML applications?
Not only in our everyday lives has ML become omnipresent, but also the number of research paper published each year has increased exponentially:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interestingly, this is not due to an abundance of groundbreaking theoretical accomplishments in the last few years (indicated as purple diamonds in the plot), but rather many of the algorithms used today were actually developed as far back as the late 50s / early 60s. For example, the perceptron is a precursor of neural networks, which are behind all the examples shown in the last section. Indeed, the most important neural network architectures, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), which provide the foundation for state-of-the-art language and image processing respectively, were developed in the early 80s and 90s. But back then we lacked the computational resources to use them on anything more than small toy datasets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why the rise in ML publications correlates more closely with the number of transistors on CPUs (i.e., the regular processors in normal computers) and GPUs (graphics cards, which parallelize the kinds of computations needed to train neural network models efficiently):</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the release of many open source libraries, such as scikit-learn (for traditional ML models) and theano, tensorflow, and (py)torch (for the implementation of neural networks), has further facilitated the use of ML algorithms in many different fields.</p>

While these libraries democratize the use of ML, unfortunately, this also brings with it the downside that ML is now often applied without a sound understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of these algorithms or their assumptions about the data. This can result in models that don&#8217;t show the expected performance and subsequently some (misplaced) disappointment in ML. In the worst case, it can lead to models that discriminate against certain parts of the population, e.g., credit scoring algorithms used by banks that systematically give women loans at higher interest rates than men due to biases encoded in the historical data used to train the models. We&#8217;ll discuss these kinds of issues in the chapter on avoiding common pitfalls.

<p>Another factor driving the spread of ML is the availability of (digital) data. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta have had a head start here, as their business model was built around data from the start, but other companies are starting to catch up. While traditional ML models do not benefit much from all this available data, large neural network models with many degrees of freedom can now show their full potential by learning from all the texts and images posted every day on the Internet:</p>

<p>An AGI is a hypothetical computer system with human-like cognitive abilities capable of understanding, learning, and performing a <strong>wide range of tasks across diverse domains</strong>. Specifically, an AGI would not only perform specific tasks but also understand and learn from its environment, make decisions autonomously, and <strong>generalize its knowledge to completely new situations</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, what is used in practice today is <strong>Artificial <em>Narrow</em> Intelligence</strong> (ANI): models <strong>explicitly programmed to solve a specific task(s)</strong>, e.g., translate texts from one language to another. But they <strong>can&#8217;t generalize (on their own) to handle novel tasks</strong>, i.e., a machine translation model will not tomorrow decide that it now also wants to recognize faces in images. Of course, one can combine several individual ANIs into one big program trained to <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-generalist-agent/" target="\_blank">solve multiple different tasks</a>, but this collection of ANIs is still not able to learn (on its own) any new skills beyond these capabilities.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many AI researchers believe that at least with the currently used approaches to AI (e.g., large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT from OpenAI), we might never produce a true human-like AGI.

<p>Let&#8217;s take a step back. Because it all begins with data.
You&#8217;ve probably heard this claim before: &#8220;Data is the new oil!&#8221;. This suggests that data is valuable. But is it?<br>
The reason why oil is considered valuable is because we have important use cases for it: powering our cars, heating our homes, and producing plastics or fertilizers.
Similarly, our data is only as valuable as what we make of it. So what can we use data for?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By visualizing important variables or <em>Key Performance Indicators</em> (KPIs) in <strong>reports</strong> or <strong>dashboards</strong>, we increase transparency of the status quo and quantify our progress towards some goal.

Simply speaking, an <strong>algorithm</strong> can be thought of as a <strong>strategy or recipe for solving a certain kind of problem</strong>. For example, there exist effective algorithms to find the shortest paths between two cities (e.g., used in Google Maps to give directions) or to solve scheduling problems, such as: &#8220;Which task should be done first and which task after that to finish all tasks before their respective deadlines and satisfy dependencies between the tasks.&#8221; Machine learning deals with the subset of algorithms that detect and make use of statistical regularities in a dataset to obtain specific results.

Besides ML, AI includes, for example, some search algorithms that were used for building the first chess computers. ML can be divided into three main subfields, unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, the subfield &#8220;deep learning&#8221; is a buzzword for neural network models and also includes Generative AI (GenAI) models like ChatGPT. Some of the simplest algorithms used in ML, like linear regression or PCA (very similar to factor analysis), are also used by statisticians, who additionally use other tools, like hypothesis tests, which do not learn rules or patterns from data. Finally, most data scientists use many tools from ML and statistics, but they as well use some additional tools like A/B tests, e.g., for collecting data on whether a red or green &#8220;buy&#8221; button on a website generates more sales, which do not fall into any of the other categories.</span></div>

<p>In the above examples, while a human (expert) could easily produce the correct output given the input (e.g., even a small child can recognize the cat in the first image), humans have a hard time describing <em>how</em> they arrived at the correct answer (e.g., how did you know that this is a cat (and not a small dog)? because of the pointy ears? the whiskers?).

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While <strong>traditional software</strong> solutions are used to automate tasks that can be formulated as a fixed, predefined sequence of actions, executed according to some <strong>hard-coded rules</strong> (e.g., &#8220;a gate should open <em>if</em> an object passes through a photoelectric barrier and 20 seconds later the gate should close again&#8221;), machine learning can be used to <strong>automate &#8220;input &#8594; output&#8221; tasks</strong> for which it would otherwise be <strong>difficult to come up with such rules</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the quality control in a cookie factory is such an &#8220;input (cookie) &#8594; output (ok/defective)&#8221; task: While some broken cookies could be sorted out automatically by checking that each cookie weights around 15g, it would be difficult to formulate rules that reliably catch all possible defects. So either a human could watch the production line to additionally recognize, e.g., over-baked cookies, or one could take pictures of the cookies and use them as input for a machine learning model to recognize the defective cookies:</p>

<p>To solve this problem with ML, first a large dataset needs to be compiled with photos of many good, but also all kinds of defective cookies, including the corresponding annotations, i.e., a label for each picture whether it displays a good or defective cookie (not necessarily specifying the kind of defect).

The next idea is to try to predict in advance whether a product will be faulty or not based on the composition of raw materials and the proposed process conditions: success here is unclear, since the human experts are not sure whether all of the information necessary to determine if the product will be fine is contained in this data&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but nevertheless it&#8217;s worth a try since this could save lots of resources. While the final ML model that solves the input-output problem can be deployed as software in the ongoing process, when a data scientist analyzes the results and interprets the model, she can additionally generate insights that can be translated into action recommendations.</span></div>

<p>Prioritize: which project will have a high impact, but at the same time also a good chance of success, i.e., should yield a high return on investment (ROI)?

In contrast, identifying the root causes of why a production process results in 10% scrap could save millions, but it is not clear from the start that such an analysis will yield useful results, since the collected data on the process conditions might not contain all the needed information.</p>

<p>How do ML algorithms solve these &#8220;input &#8594; output&#8221; problems, i.e., how do they recognize patterns and learn rules from data?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The set of ML algorithms can be subdivided according to their learning strategy. This is inspired by how humans learn:</p>

<div class="title"><span class="small"><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Humans are very good at picking up on statistical regularities in the world without being explicitly instructed to do so. For example, have you ever noticed that we don&#8217;t &#8230;&#8203; make &#8230;&#8203; pauses &#8230;&#8203; between &#8230;&#8203; words when we speak? Yet kids still intuitively learn which syllables make up a word and where this word ends and the next one begins. This is possible, because the syllables in a single word always occur in this specific combination, while this word can then be followed by many different words, starting with many different syllables. This means, simply by hearing lots of spoken text, we pick up on the conditional probability distributions of syllables. <strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> This type of learning requires a teacher that tells us what the right answers are and corrects us, if we get something wrong. For example, when teaching a kid the meaning of a word, we explicitly tell them what this word means, and if they mislabel something, e.g., call a small dog a cat, we correct them. <strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> This kind of learning-by-doing again happens naturally when humans learn from the consequences of their actions. For example, through experimentation and practice, we can figure out a complex sequence of hand movements to elicit beautiful sounds from a violin instead of producing painful screeches. While no single hand movement by itself is inherently good or bad, only the right combination will bring music to our ears.</span></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Analogously, machines can also learn by following these three strategies:</p>

<div class="title"><span class="small"><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> These algorithms pick up on statistical regularities in the data, for example, they can find groups of similar items (like in the customer segmentation task) or identify individual points that stand out (i.e., anomaly detection), e.g., unusual behavior of a machine due to a broken part or suspicious credit card transactions. <strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> These algorithms learn from many input-output examples, e.g., images and what is shown on these images or production conditions and whether the product that was produced under these conditions is faulty or okay. The learned model can then be used to predict the output for some new input. <strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> This type of learning is a bit more involved: Here the learning algorithm is also called an agent, which operates within an environment, e.g., a robot moving around in the real world or a virtual agent inside a simulation environment like a video game (which is usually much cheaper ;-)). The environment lets the agent know in which state or situation it currently is, then the agent can select how to react in this state, i.e., which (predefined) action to take, and then the environment determines the consequences of this action (e.g., kill a monster in a video game or fall off a cliff) and returns a reward depending on the outcome (e.g., extra points for collecting coins). Then the cycle repeats as the agent is in the next state. Based on the received reward, the agent learns over time which actions are beneficial in which situations and how to navigate the environment. The hard part here is that the reward signals often come much later after the action was executed, for example, in a video game, an agent collects a key at the beginning of a level, but the door that can be opened with this key comes many frames later, which means the reward will be delayed and the agent has a hard time associating this reward with the appropriate action. Since humans have a lot of background knowledge, figuring out what works and what doesn&#8217;t in a game is much easier for us.</span></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Supervised learning is the most common type of machine learning used in today&#8217;s applications.<br>
The goal here is to learn a <strong>model (= a mathematical function)</strong> \(f(x)\) that describes the relationship between some <strong>input(s)</strong> \(x\) (e.g., different process conditions like temperature, type of material, etc.) and <strong>output</strong> \(y\) (e.g., resulting product quality).<br>
This model can then be used to <strong>make predictions for new data points</strong>, i.e., compute \(f(x') = y'\) for some new \(x'\) (e.g., predict for a new set of process conditions whether the produced product will be of high quality or if the process should be stopped to not waste resources).</p>

Then, we need to collect data&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and since we&#8217;re using supervised learning, this needs to be <em>labeled</em> data, with the labels corresponding to the target variable that we want to predict. Next, we &#8220;learn&#8221; (or &#8220;train&#8221; or &#8220;fit&#8221;) a model on this data and finally use it to generate predictions for new data points.</span></div>

<p><strong>Features &amp; Labels</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A production process, where we want to predict whether a produced part is scrap given certain production conditions, is an example of a typical supervised learning problem. Here, the collected data for each produced part includes the process conditions under which it was produced, as well as the outcome, i.e., whether the product was okay or scrap:</p>

<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/02_data/toy_data6.png" alt="image" width="740">
</div>
<div class="title"><span class="small">The columns of the table contain the different measurements / variables that were collected for each sample. Here we distinguish between <em>features</em> (in this case the production conditions) and <em>labels</em> (whether the product produced under these conditions is okay or scrap). Features, also denoted as a matrix \(X\), are typically those measurements that we get basically for free, as they are often collected during the process for other purposes anyways. For example, when the operator of the machine sets the temperature for the production to a certain value, this is recorded as the signal is passed along to the heating unit. The corresponding labels, denoted as a vector \(\mathbf{y}\), are often more expensive to collect. For example, in the production process, to collect a data point with the label <em>"scrap"</em>, we have to (intentionally) produce a broken product, costing us valuable resources. Another example: Google had to pay a team of specialist doctors to discuss and re-label some of the diabetic retinopathy images about which there existed conflicting opinions.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the supervised learning setup, the features are used as the input to the model, while the labels constitute the target variable, i.e., the predicted output. Generally, features should be independent variables (e.g., settings that the operator can choose as he wishes), while the target value should be dependent on these inputs&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;otherwise we can&#8217;t predict it from these inputs alone.</p>

<p>The available supervised learning algorithms differ in the <strong>type of \(x \to y\) relationship</strong> they can describe (e.g., linear or nonlinear) and what kind of <strong>objective</strong> they minimize (also called loss function; an error computed on the training data, quantifying the mismatch between true and predicted labels). The task of a data scientist is to select a type of model that can optimally fit the given data. The rest is then taken care of by an <strong>optimization method, which finds the parameters of the model that minimize the model&#8217;s objective</strong>, i.e., such that the model&#8217;s prediction error on the given data is as small as possible.</p>

In most of the book, the terms &#8220;ML algorithm&#8221; and &#8220;ML model&#8221; will be used interchangeably. To be more precise, however, in general the algorithm processes the data and learns some parameter values. These parameter settings define the final model. For example, a linear regression <em>model</em> is defined by its coefficients (i.e., the model&#8217;s parameters), which are found by executing the steps outlined in the linear regression <em>algorithm</em>, which includes solving an optimization problem.

<div class="title"><span class="small">In many use cases, it is not enough to &#8220;only&#8221; predict the target for a new data point, e.g., predict whether a product produced under certain conditions will be of high quality or not. Instead, it is often necessary to additionally be able to explain <em>why</em> this prediction was made, e.g., which input feature values were the deciding factors, both to better understand possible root causes of a problem, but also to be assured that the model is basing its predictions on reasonable assumptions. Furthermore, a learned model can also be used within an outer optimization loop, i.e., in the simplest case one could systematically check what product quality the model predicts for different process conditions and then select the settings with the highest predicted quality to produce new products. But keep in mind that ML models are only built to interpolate, not extrapolate, i.e., make sure the settings that are tested are withing the training domain.</span></div>

<div class="title"><span class="small">The main distinction when characterizing data is made between <em>structured</em> data, which is any dataset that contains individual measurements / variables / attributes / features that represent unique quantities, and <em>unstructured</em> data, which can not be subdivided into meaningful variables. For example, in images &#8220;first pixel from the left&#8221; or in texts &#8220;10th word in the second paragraph&#8221; is not what we would call a variable, while &#8220;size in square meters&#8221; and &#8220;number of bedrooms&#8221; are useful quantities to describe an apartment. Structured data is often <em>heterogeneous</em>, since the different variables in a dataset typically stand for very different things. For example, when working with sensor data, a dataset normally does not consist of only temperature measurements, but additionally it could contain, e.g., pressure and flow values, which have different units and measurement scales. Unstructured data, on the other hand, is <em>homogeneous</em>, e.g., there is no qualitative difference between the 10th and the 100th pixel in an image.</span></div>

If we want to discover patterns in the data, then we would also choose an algorithm from the field of unsupervised learning, but here it depends on which kinds of patterns we want to find: Anomaly detection algorithms identify individual data points that deviate from the rest (e.g., a malfunctioning machine or a fraudulent credit card transaction). Clustering algorithms identify groups of similar data points (e.g., for customer segmentation). If our goal is to make specific predictions, i.e., given an input get a corresponding output (e.g., predict whether a product will be faulty if it is produced under certain conditions), then we need to use an algorithm from the area of supervised learning. Here the main distinction is between regression and classification models: in regression tasks, the target variable that should be predicted is continuous (e.g., number of users, price, etc.), while in classification tasks the target variable is discrete, i.e., can only take on one distinct value and there is no continuum between the different values (e.g., an animal in a picture can either be a cat or a dog, but not something in between). While unsupervised and supervised learning cover most general use cases, other algorithms exist for more specific applications, e.g., recommender systems or generative AI.</span></div>

Even if our ultimate goal is to predict something (i.e., use supervised learning), it can still be helpful to first use unsupervised learning to get a better understanding of the dataset, for example, by visualizing the data with dimensionality reduction methods to see all samples and their diversity at a glance, by identifying outliers to clean the dataset, or, for classification problems, by first clustering the samples to check whether the given class labels match the naturally occurring groups in the data or if, e.g., two very similar classes could be combined to simplify the problem.

<div class="title"><span class="small">The first step when working with a new dataset is usually to visualize it, to get a better overview of all the samples and their diversity. This is done with a dimensionality reduction algorithm, which takes the original high dimensional data as input, where each column (= feature) in the table is one dimension, and outputs a lower dimensional representation of the samples, i.e., a new matrix with fewer columns (usually two for a visualization). With these two new features, here called \(z_1\) and \(z_2\), we can create a scatter plot of the dataset, where each sample / row (in this case each apartment) is represented as one point in this new 2D coordinate system. We can think of this plot as a map of our dataset that enables us to view all data points at a glance. This plot often shows interesting patterns, for example, groups of similar points, which would be located close to each other in this 2D map. Please note that for most dimensionality reduction methods, it is not possible to describe what is behind this new coordinate system. Specifically, these are not just the two most informative original features, but completely new dimensions that summarize the information of the original inputs. To better interpret these plots, it is helpful to color the dots afterwards by some variable, which can then reveal the driving factors behind the most salient patterns in the dataset. In this example, we could have used the price of each apartment to color the respective dot in the map, which might then reveal that similarly priced apartments are arranged next to each other.</span></div>

An outlier detection algorithm outputs for each sample an anomaly score, which indicates whether this data point deviates from the norm. We can use these scores to colorize the 2D map of the dataset generated in the previous step to see the anomalies in context. One drawback is that an anomaly detection algorithm does not tell us <em>why</em> it considers an individual point an outlier. A data scientist needs to examine the points identified as outlier to see, e.g., if these should be removed due to flawed measurements or if they constitute some interesting edge cases. In this example, the sample identified as an anomaly is an apartment that supposedly has a size of only 35 \(m^2\), but at the same time 5 bedrooms, i.e., most likely the person that originally entered the data made a mistake and the size of the listing should actually be 135 \(m^2\).</span></div>

Please note that these cluster indices are not ordered and when running the algorithm again, the samples might be assigned different numbers, however, the groups of samples that were assigned the same number should still be in a cluster together, i.e., this cluster might now just be called &#8216;5&#8217; instead of &#8216;3&#8217;. These cluster indices can again be used to colorize the 2D map of the dataset to see the clusters in context. While a clustering algorithm groups similar points together, it does not tell us <em>why</em> the points were assigned to a cluster and what this cluster means. Therefore, the data scientist again needs to examine the results to try to describe the different clusters. In our example, the clusters might be &#8220;cheap studio apartments&#8221;, &#8220;large family apartments&#8221;, and &#8220;luxurious penthouses&#8221;.

<div class="title"><span class="small">This might look like an input-output problem, but it would be very difficult and inefficient to solve it directly. Instead, we break the problem down into smaller subtasks that can be solved with existing algorithms:</span></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title"><span class="small">First, the smart speaker needs to know whether it was activated with a specific trigger word (e.g., &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221;). This is a simple binary classification task (trigger word: yes/no), which is usually performed on the device itself, since we don&#8217;t want that everything we say is continuously streamed into the cloud. Next, the spoken words that follow the trigger word are transcribed into text. Text is easier to handle, because, for example, variations due to different accents are removed. Based on this text, the intent is recognized, i.e., which of the different functionalities of the virtual assistant should be used (e.g., tell a joke, play music, set an alarm, etc.). This is a multi-class classification problem. The next step is to execute the request, which is not done with ML, but instead some task-specific program is run, e.g., to select a joke from a database or set a timer, etc., based on the apps installed on the device. Finally, the output of the program needs to be converted back into an audio signal. For this again an ML model can help to get smoothly spoken text&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and in the near future maybe with the voice of Morgan Freeman or some other famous person like in "Deep Fake" applications.</span></div>
<p><br>
&#8658; It is generally advisable to first think about how a problem could be decomposed into easier-to-solve subproblems, especially since there might already be a large dataset or pre-trained ML model available for one of these subtasks. For example, speech recognition models can be trained on audio books and transcribed political speeches in addition to the data collected from the smart speaker users.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What problem do you want to solve?</strong><br>
Machine learning can help you in various ways by generating insights from large amounts of (possibly unstructured) data, improving decision making and planning processes by providing predictions about future events, or automating tedious tasks otherwise requiring human experts.<br>
Where do you see a lot of inefficiencies around you that could be mitigated by a better use of data? For example, you could look for opportunities to decrease wasted resources / time / costs or increase revenue / customer satisfaction / etc.<br>
To systematically identify problems or opportunities, it can be helpful to create a process map or customer journey map.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>In what way(s) would this generate value for your organization?</strong><br>
How could your organization make money on this or reduce costs?<br></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Could this <em>improve an internal process</em> (e.g., maybe a process can be run more efficiently with the insights from an analysis or a tedious task that would otherwise require a human worker can be automated using an ML model)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could the ML model be integrated as a <em>new feature within an existing product</em> and thereby, e.g., make this product more appealing to customers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could the ML solution be sold as an entirely <em>new product or service</em>, e.g., offered as a <em>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution</em>?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="small">Please note that how the ML solution will be used in the end might also be a strategic decision that can be different for every organization. For example, an ML solution that recognizes scratches in produced products might be used by one company to improve their internal production process, while another company that produces the machines that make the products could integrate this as a new feature in their machines, and a third company might offer this as a SaaS solution compatible with different production lines.</span></p>

<p><strong>Core vs. generic domain: Does this create a strategic advantage?</strong><br>
Will the solution be a key part of your business, e.g., a new feature that makes your product more attractive, and/or does it require unique subject matter expertise only available at your organization, e.g., because you&#8217;re analyzing data generated by your own specific processes/machines? Or is this a common (but complex) problem, for which a solution already exists (e.g., offered as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product), that you could buy off the shelf?<br>
For example, extracting the relevant information from scanned invoices to automate bookkeeping processes is a relatively complex task for which many good solutions already exist, so unless you are working in a company building bookkeeping software and plan to sell a better alternative to these existing solutions, it probably doesn&#8217;t make sense to implement this yourself.</p>

<p>Once a suitable &#8220;input &#8594; output&#8221; problem as been identified, <strong>historical data needs to be gathered and the right ML algorithm needs to be selected and applied</strong> to obtain a working solution. This is what the next chapters are all about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To solve a concrete problem using ML, we follow a workflow like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/01c_ds_workflow/data_science_workflow_17.png" alt="image" width="840">
</div>
<div class="title"><span class="small">We always start with some kind of question or problem that should be solved with ML. And to solve it, we need data, which we most likely have to clean before we can work with it (e.g., merge different excel files, fix missing values, etc.). Then it&#8217;s time for an exploratory analysis to better understand what we&#8217;re dealing with. Depending on the type of data, we also need to extract appropriate features or engineer additional ones, for which domain knowledge / subject matter expertise is invaluable. All these steps are grouped under "preprocessing" <em>(red box)</em> and the steps are not linear, as we often find ourselves jumping back and forth between them. For example, by visualizing the dataset, we realize that the data contains some outliers that need to be removed, or after engineering new features, we go back and visualize the dataset again. Next comes the ML part <em>(green box)</em>: we normally start with some simple model, evaluate it, try a more complex model, experiment with different hyperparameters, &#8230;&#8203; and at some point realize, that we&#8217;ve exhausted our ML toolbox and are still not happy with the performance. This means we need to go back and either engineer better features or, if this also doesn&#8217;t help, collect more and/or better data (e.g., more samples, data from additional sensors, cleaner labels, etc.). Finally, when we&#8217;re confident in the model&#8217;s predictions, there are two routes we can take: Either the data science route, where we communicate our findings to the stakeholders (which most likely results in further questions). Or the ML software route, where the final model is deployed in production. Here it is important to continuously monitor the model&#8217;s performance and collect new data such that the model can be retrained, especially as the inevitable data or concept drifts occur. Above all, working on a machine learning project is a very iterative process.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, due to a lack of standardized data infrastructure in many companies, the sad truth is that usually (at least) about 90% of a Data Scientist&#8217;s time is spent collecting, cleaning, and otherwise preprocessing the data to get it into a format where the ML algorithms can be applied:</p>

<p>While sometimes frustrating, the time spent cleaning and preprocessing the data is never wasted, as only with a solid data foundation the ML algorithms can achieve decent results.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_3_get_it_ready_for_production">3. Get it ready for production</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the prototypical solution has been implemented and meets the required performance level, this solution then has to be deployed, i.e., <strong>integrated into the general workflow and infrastructure</strong> so that it can actually be used to improve the respective process in practice (as a piece of software that continuously makes predictions for new data points).
This might also require building some additional software around the ML model such as an API to programmatically query the model or a dedicated user interface to interact with the system.
Finally, there are generally two strategies for how to run the finished solution:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>The ML model runs on an &#8220;edge&#8221; device</strong>, i.e., on each individual machine (e.g., mobile phone) where the respective data is generated and the output of the model is used in subsequent process steps. This is often the best strategy when results need to be computed in real time and / or a continuous Internet connection can not be guaranteed, e.g., in self-driving cars. However, the downside of this is that, depending on the type of ML model, comparatively expensive computing equipment needs to be installed in each machine, e.g., GPUs for neural network models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The ML model runs in the &#8220;cloud&#8221;</strong>, i.e., on a central server (either on-premise or provisioned from a cloud provider such as AWS), e.g., in the form of a web application that receives data from individual users, processes it, and sends back the results. This is often the more efficient solution, if a response within a few seconds is sufficient for the use case. However, processing personal information in the cloud also raises privacy concerns. One of the major benefits of this solution is that it is easier to update the ML model, for example, when more historical data becomes available or if the process changes and the model now has to deal with slightly different inputs (we&#8217;ll discuss this further in later chapters).</p>

As a data analyst you are sometimes approached with <strong>more specific questions or requests</strong> such as &#8220;We&#8217;re deciding where to launch a new marketing campaign. Can you show me the number of users for all European countries?&#8221;. In these cases it can be helpful to <strong>ask &#8220;why?&#8221; to understand where the person noticed something unexpected</strong> that prompted this analysis request. If the answer is &#8220;Oh, we just have some marketing budget left over and need to spend the money somewhere&#8221; then just give them the results. But if the answer is &#8220;Our revenue for this quarter was lower than expected&#8221; it might be worth <strong>exploring other possible root causes</strong> for this, as maybe the problem is not the number of users that visit the website, but that many users drop out before they reach the checkout page and the money might be better invested in a usability study to understand why users don&#8217;t complete the sale.

<p>Before we conduct a data analysis we need to be clear on:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who are the <strong>relevant stakeholders</strong>, i.e., who will consume the data analysis results (= our audience / dashboard users)?</p>

<p>In business contexts, the users' goals are usually in some way related to making a profit for the company, i.e., increasing revenue (e.g., by solving a customer problem more effectively than the competition) or reducing costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The progress towards these goals is tracked with so called <strong><em>Key Performance Indicators</em> (KPIs)</strong>, i.e., custom metrics that tell us how well things are going. For example, if we&#8217;re working on a web application, one KPI we might want to track could be &#8220;user happiness&#8221;. Unfortunately, true user happiness is difficult to measure, but we can instead check the number of users returning to our site and how long they stay and then somehow combine these and other measurements into a proxy variable that we then call &#8220;user happiness&#8221;.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Lagging vs. Leading KPIs</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unfortunately, the things we really care about can often only be <strong>measured after the fact, i.e., when it is too late to take corrective action</strong>. For example, in sales we care about &#8220;realized revenue&#8221;, i.e., money in the bank, but if the revenue at the end of the quarter is less than what we hoped for, we can only try to do better next quarter. These metrics are called <strong>lagging KPIs</strong>.<br>
<strong>Leading KPIs</strong> instead tell us when we should <strong>act before it&#8217;s too late</strong>. For example, in sales this could be the volume of deals in the sales pipeline, i.e., while not all of these deals might eventually go through and result in realized revenue, if the pipeline is empty we know for certain that we wont reach our revenue goals.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the causal relationships between variables are too complex to identify leading KPIs directly, we can instead try to <strong>use a machine learning model to predict lagging KPIs</strong>. For example, in a polymer production process, an important quality metric may be the tensile strength measured 24 hours after the polymer hardens. Waiting for these results could lead to discarding the last 24 hours of production if the quality is subpar.
If the relationships between the process parameters (such as production temperature) and the resulting quality are too complex to identify a leading KPI, we could instead train an ML model on the past process parameters (inputs) and corresponding quality measurements (outputs) to then continuously predict the quality during production. When the model predicts that the quality is off-target, the operators can intervene and fix issues before significant production time is wasted.<br>
However, relying on an ML model introduces the need to monitor its predictions for trustworthiness. In our example, the <strong>prediction accuracy on new data serves as a lagging KPI</strong>, as we only know whether the predictions are correct after real measurements arrive 24 hours later. As a <strong>leading KPI</strong>, we can measure the discrepancy between process parameter values used in model training and those received in production to identify <strong>dataset drifts</strong>. These drifts, such as changes in values due to sensor malfunctions, can lead to inaccurate predictions for affected samples.</p>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step when making a data-driven decision is to <strong>realize that we should act by monitoring our KPIs</strong> to see whether we&#8217;re on track to achieve our goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally, this is achieved by combining these metrics with <strong>thresholds for alerts</strong> to automatically notify us if things go south and a corrective action becomes necessary. For example, we could establish some alert on the health of a system or machine to notify a technician when maintenance is necessary. To <strong>avoid alert fatigue</strong>, it is important to reduce false alarms, i.e., configure the alert such that the responsible person tells you &#8220;when this threshold is reached, I will drop everything else and go fix the problem&#8221; (<em>not</em> &#8220;at this point we should probably keep an eye on it&#8221;).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on how frequently the value of the KPI changes and how quickly corrective actions show effects, we want to check for the alert condition either every few minutes to alert someone in real time or, for example, every morning, every Monday, or once per month if the values change more slowly.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Is this significant?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Small variations in KPIs are normal and we should not overreact to noise. Statistics can tell us <strong>whether the observed deviation from what we expected is significant</strong>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Statistical inference enables us to <strong>draw conclusions that reach beyond the data at hand</strong>. Often we would like to make a statement about a whole <em>population</em> (e.g., all humans currently living on this earth), but we only have access to a few (hopefully representative) observations to draw our conclusion from. Statistical inference is about changing our mind under uncertainty: We start with a null hypothesis (i.e., what we expected before looking at the data) and then check if what we see in the sample dataset makes this null hypothesis look ridiculous, at which point we reject it and go with our alternative hypothesis instead.<br>
<span class="underline">Example:</span> <em>Your company has an online store and wants to roll out a new recommendation system, but you are unsure whether customers will find these recommendations helpful and buy more. Therefore, before going live with the new system, you perform an A/B test, where a percentage of randomly selected users see the new recommendations, while the others are routed to the original version of the online store. The null hypothesis is that the new version is no better than the original. But it turns out that the average sales volume of customers seeing the new recommendations is a lot higher than that of the customers browsing the original site. This difference is so large that in a world where the null hypothesis was true, it would be extremely unlikely that a random sample would give us these results. We therefore reject the null hypothesis and go with the alternative hypothesis, that the new recommendations generate higher sales.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to rigorous statistical tests, there are also some rules of thumb to determine whether changes in the data warrant our attention: If a single sample lies three standard deviations (\(\sigma\)) above or below the mean or seven consecutive points fall above or below the average value, this is cause for further investigation.</p>

<p>For every alert that is created, i.e., every time it is clear that a corrective action is needed, it is worth considering whether this action can be automated and to directly <strong>trigger this automated action together with the alert</strong> (e.g., if the performance of an ML model drops below a certain threshold, instead of just notifying the data scientist we could automatically trigger a retraining with the most recent data). If this is not possible, e.g., because it is not clear what exactly happened and therefore which action should be taken, we need a deeper analysis.</p>

<p>Digging deeper into the data can help us answer questions such as &#8220;Why did we not reach this goal and how can we do better?&#8221; (or, in rarer cases, &#8220;Why did we exceeded this goal and how can we do it again?&#8221;) to <strong>decide on the specific action</strong> to take.</p>

<dd>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Relevant data is spread across multiple databases / excel sheets that need to be joined. <em>Worst case:</em> Data points don&#8217;t have a unique ID based on which the different entries can be linked. Instead one has to fall back on some error prone strategy like matching data based on time stamps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manually entered values contains errors, e.g., misplaced decimal points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not possible to correct missing values. <em>Worst case:</em> Missing values are not random. For example, sensors fail only right before something goes wrong during the production process. Or in surveys, rich people more often decline to answer questions regarding their income compared to poor or middle class people. This introduces a systematic bias in the dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dataset consists of different data types (structured and/or unstructured) with different scales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process setup changes over time, e.g., due to some external conditions like replacing a sensor or some other maintenance event, which means the data collected from different time periods are incompatible. <em>Worst case:</em> These external changes were not recorded anywhere and we only notice at the end of the analysis that the data we were working with violated our assumptions.</p>

<p>Small dataset and/or too little variation, e.g., we produced only a few defective products or a process runs in a steady state most of the time, i.e., there is little or no variation in the inputs.<br>
&#8594; Effect of different input variables on the target can&#8217;t be estimated reliably from only a few observations.<br>
&#8658; Do some experiments where you systematically vary different inputs to collect a more diverse dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data is inconsistent / incomplete, i.e., same inputs with different outputs, e.g., two products were produced under the same (measured) conditions, one is fine, the other is faulty.<br>
This can have two reasons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The labels are very noisy, for example, because the human annotators didn&#8217;t follow the same set of clear rules or some examples were ambiguous, e.g., one QA-expert deems a product with a small scratch as still OK, while another labels it as defective.<br>
&#8658; Clean up the data by relabeling, which can take some time but will pay off! See also this great <a href="https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo" target="\_blank">MLOps / data-centric AI talk by Andrew Ng</a> on how a small high-quality dataset can be more valuable than a larger noisy dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relevant input features are missing: While it is relatively easy for humans to assess if all the relevant information is present in unstructured data (e.g., images: either we see a cat or we don&#8217;t), structured data often has too many different variables and complex interactions to know right away whether all the relevant features were included.<br>
&#8658; Talk to a subject matter expert about which additional input features might be helpful and include these in the dataset. <em>Worst case:</em> Need to install a new sensor in the machine and collect this data, i.e., all the data collected in the past is basically useless. BUT: using the right sensor can simplify the problem immensely and installing it will be worth it!<br>
<span class="small">In many applications, our first instinct is to use a camera to generate the input data, since we humans rely primarily on our visual system to solve many tasks. However, even though image recognition algorithms have come a long way, using such a setup instead of a more specialized sensor can make the solution more error prone.<br>
Trying to detect mushy strawberries? Use a near infrared (NIR) sensor instead of a regular camera like <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.co.uk/innovation/machine-learning-using-algorithms-to-sort-fruit" target="\_blank">Amazon Fresh</a> did. They still use machine learning to analyze the resulting data, but in the NIR images the rotting parts of fruits are more easily visible than in normal photos.<br>
Trying to detect if a door is closed? With a simple <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-92/" target="\_blank">magnet</a> and detector, this task can be solved without any complex analysis or training data! (You probably know the saying: &#8220;When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail&#8221;. &#8594; Don&#8217;t forget to also consider solutions outside your ML toolbox! ;-))</span></p>

If you can, observe how the data is collected. As in: actually physically stand there and watch how someone enters the values in some program or how the machine operates as the sensors measure something. You will probably notice some things that can be optimized in the data collection process directly, which will save you lots of preprocessing work in the future.

</li>
<li>
<p>Description</p>

<p>Data type (e.g., numerical or categorical values)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Date of first measurement (e.g., in case a sensor was installed later than the others)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Normal/expected range of values (&#8594; &#8220;If this variable is below this threshold, then the machine is off and the data points can be ignored.&#8221;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How missing values are recorded, i.e., whether they are recorded as missing values or substituted with some unrealistic value instead, which can happen since some sensors are not able to send a signal for &#8220;Not a Number&#8221; (NaN) directly or the database does not allow for the field to be empty.</p>

In addition to documenting datasets as a whole, it is also helpful to store metadata for individual samples. For example, for image data, this could include the time stamp of when the image was taken, the geolocation (or if the camera is built into a manufacturing machine then the ID of this machine), information about the camera settings, etc.. This can greatly help when analyzing model prediction errors, as it might turn out that, for example, images taken with a particular camera setting are especially difficult to classify, which in turn gives us some hints on how to improve the data collection process.

<p>Let&#8217;s say we have an online shop and are trying to predict how much of a product we will sell in the next month. The price we are willing to sell the product for will obviously influence the demand, as people are trying to get a good deal, i.e., the lower the price, the higher the demand; a negative correlation that can be captured by a linear model. However, the demand will never be below zero (i.e., when the price is very high, people wont suddenly return the product), so we need to adapt the model such that the predicted output is never negative. This can be achieved by applying the max function, in this context also called a nonlinear activation function, to the output of the linear model, so that now when the linear model would return a negative value, we instead predict 0.</p>

We will later see these circles as single units or &#8220;neurons&#8221; of a neural network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get better results, we can extend the model and use multiple input features for the prediction:</p>

<p>To improve the performance even further, we could now manually construct more informative features from the original inputs by combining them in meaningful ways (&#8594; feature engineering) before computing the output:</p>

<div class="title"><span class="small">Our example is about an online shop, so the customers additionally have to pay shipping fees, which means to reflect the true affordability of the product, we need to combine the product price with the shipping costs. Next, the customers are interested in high quality products. However, not only the actual quality of the raw materials we used to make the product influences how the customers perceive the product, but we can also reinforce the impression that the product is of high quality with a marketing campaign. Furthermore, a high price also suggests that the product is superior. This means by creating these additional features, the price can actually contribute in two ways towards the final prediction: while, on the one hand, a lower price is beneficial for the affordability of the product, a higher price, on the other hand, results in a larger perceived quality.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While in this toy example, it was possible to construct such features manually, the nice thing about neural networks is that they do exactly that automatically: By using multiple layers, i.e., stacking multiple linear models (with nonlinear activation functions) on top of each other, it is possible to create more and more complex combinations of the original input features, which can improve the performance of the model. The more layers the network uses, i.e., the &#8220;deeper&#8221; it is, the more complex the resulting feature representations.</p>

However, some problems do not fall into the category of simple supervised learning tasks (i.e., regression or classification), and require a different output. For example, in machine translation, the output should be the sentence translated into the other language, which can be achieved by coupling two RNNs: the first &#8216;understands&#8217; the sentence in the original language and this representation of the meaning of the sentence is then passed to a second RNN, which generates from it the translated sentence word by word. Another example is the task of image captioning (i.e., generating text describing what can be seen on an image, e.g., to improve the online experience for people with visual impairment), where first the image is &#8216;understood&#8217; by a CNN and then this representation of the input image is passed to a RNN to generate the matching text.</span></div>

<p>However, it can be quite easy to paint an overly optimistic picture here, therefore we always need to be critical and, for example, <strong>compare the performance of a model to that of a baseline</strong>.

<p>The accuracy is a very commonly used evaluation metric for classification problems:<br>
<strong>Accuracy:</strong> Fraction of samples that were classified correctly.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below we see the decision boundaries of two models on a toy dataset, where the background color indicates whether the model predicts the blue or red class for a data point in this area. Which model do you think is more useful?</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With unbalanced class distributions, e.g., in this case a lot more samples from the blue compared to the red class, the accuracy of a model that simply always predicts the most frequent class can be quite large. But while a 90% accuracy might sound impressive when we report the performance of a model to the project&#8217;s stakeholders, this does not necessarily mean that the model is actually useful, especially since in real world problems the undersampled class is often the one we care about most, e.g., people with a rare disease or products that have a defect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, the balanced accuracy is often the more informative measure when evaluating classification models and can help us to distinguish between a model that has actually learned something and the &#8216;stupid baseline&#8217;:<br>
<strong>Balanced Accuracy:</strong> First the fraction of correctly classified samples is computed for each class individually and then these values are averaged.</p>

<p>We want a model that captures the &#8216;input &#8594; output&#8217; relationship in the data and is capable of interpolating, i.e., we need to check:<br>
<strong>Does the model generate reliable predictions for new data points from the same distribution as the training set?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this does not ensure that the model has actually learned any true causal relationship between inputs and outputs and can extrapolate beyond the training domain (we&#8217;ll discuss this in the next section), at least we can be reasonably sure that the model will generate reliable predictions for data points similar to those used for training the model. If this isn&#8217;t given, the model is not only wrong, it&#8217;s also useless.</p>

<p>The graphic below is taken from a paper where the authors noticed that a fairly simple ML model (not a neural network) trained on a standard image classification dataset performed poorly for all ten classes in the dataset except one, horses. When they examined the dataset more closely and analyzed <em>why</em> the model predicted a certain class, i.e., which image features were used in the prediction (displayed as the heatmap on the right), they noticed that most of the pictures of horses in the dataset were taken by the same photographer and they all had a characteristic copyright notice in the lower left corner.</p>

<p>By relying on this artifact, the model could identify what it perceives as &#8220;horses&#8221; in this dataset with high accuracy&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;both in the training and the test set, which includes pictures from the same photographer. However, of course the model failed to learn what actually defines a horse and would not be able to extrapolate and achieve the same accuracy on other horse pictures without this copyright notice.
Or, equally problematic, one could add such a copyright notice to a picture of another animal and suddenly the model would mistakenly classify this as a horse, too. This means, it is possible to purposefully trick the model, which is also called an &#8220;adversarial attack&#8221;.</p>

<p>This is by far not the only example where a model has &#8220;cheated&#8221; by exploiting spurious correlations in the training set.

<p><strong>Adversarial Attacks: Fooling ML models on purpose</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An adversarial attack on an ML model is performed by asking the model to make a prediction for an input that was modified in such a way that a human is unaware of the change and would still arrive at a correct result, but the ML model changes its prediction to something else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, while an ML model can easily recognize the &#8216;Stop&#8217; sign from the image on the left, the sign on the right is mistaken as a speed limit sign due to the strategically placed, inconspicuous stickers, which humans would just ignore:</p>

<p>This happened because the model didn&#8217;t pick up on the true reasons humans identify a Stop sign as such, e.g., the octagonal form and the four white letters spelling &#8216;STOP&#8217; on a red background. Instead it relied on less meaningful correlations to distinguish it from other traffic signs.<br>
Convolutional neural networks (CNN), the type of neural net typically used for image classification tasks, rely a lot on local patterns. This is why they are often easily <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/turtle-or-rifle-hackers-easily-fool-ais-seeing-wrong-thing" target="\_blank">fooled</a> by leaving the global shape of objects, which humans rely on for identification, intact and overlaying the images with specific textures or other high-frequency patterns to trick the model into predicting a different class.</p>

<p>The first step to mitigating these problems is to become aware of them. Therefore, it is important to always assess the model&#8217;s performance for each (known) subgroup individually to verify that the prediction errors of the model are random and the model is not systematically worse for some subgroups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We should also <strong>be careful when including variables in the model that encode attributes such as gender or ethnicity</strong>. For example, the performance of a model that diagnoses heart attacks will most likely be improved by including &#8216;gender&#8217; as a feature, since men and women present different symptoms when they have a heart attack. On the other hand, a model that assigns someone a credit score should probably not rely on the gender of the person for this decision, since, even though this might have been the case in the historical data because the humans that generated the data relied on their own stereotypes, women should not get a lower score just because they are female.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, a person&#8217;s gender or ethnicity, for example, is often correlated with other variables such as income or neighborhood, so even inconspicuous features can still leak problematic information to the model and require some extra steps to ensure the model does not discriminate.</p>

<p>Data drifts occur when our model has to make predictions for samples that are different from the data it encountered during training, e.g., because certain regimes of the training domain were undersampled, or in the extreme case the model might even be forced to extrapolate beyond the training domain, for example, due to</p>

<p>seasonal trends result in changes in the popularity of summer vs. winder clothes &#8658; include month / outside temperature as an additional input feature</p>

<p>special events, e.g., a celebrity mentioned our product on social media or people changed their behavior because of the lockdown during a pandemic &#8658; while it can be hard to predict these events in advance, when they happen we could include an additional feature, e.g., &#8216;during lockdown&#8217;, to distinguish data collected during this time period from the rest of the data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>degenerate feedback loops, i.e., the existence of the model changes users' behavior, e.g., a recommender system causes users to click on videos just because they were recommended &#8658; include as an additional feature whether the video was recommended or not to learn how much of &#8220;user clicked on item&#8221; was due to the item being recommended and how much was due to the user&#8217;s natural behavior</p>

While our output is influenced by the true temperature, we only have access to the sensor reading for the temperature, which is additionally influenced by the state of the sensor itself &#8658; try to estimate the amount of accumulated limescale, e.g., based on the number of days since the sensor was cleaned the last time (which also means that these kinds of maintenance events need to be recorded somewhere!)</p>

Even when the correct variables are incorporated to capture a concept drift, frequent model retraining may still be necessary. For instance, different states of the concept might be sampled unevenly, leading to data drifts (e.g., more data collected during winter than in the early summer months). If it is not possible to include variables that account for the concept drift, it might be necessary to <strong>remove samples from the original training set that do not conform to the novel input/output relation before retraining the model</strong>.</p>

The best way to counteract data and concept drifts is to frequently <strong>retrain the model</strong> on new data. This can either happen on a schedule (e.g., every weekend, depending on how quickly the data changes) or when your monitoring system raises an alert because it detected drifts in the inputs or a deteriorating model performance.

<p>You were already warned that in their day-to-day operations, data scientists usually spend only about 10% of their time doing the fun machine learning stuff, while the bulk of their work consists of gathering and cleaning data. This is true for an individual ML project. If your goal is to become a data-driven enterprise that uses AI in production for a wide range of applications, there are some additional challenges that should be addressed&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but which would typically not be the responsibility of a data scientist (alone):</p>

<p>In the introduction, you&#8217;ve seen the Venn diagram showing that ML lies at the intersection of math and computer science. However, this is actually not the complete picture. In the previous chapters, you&#8217;ve hopefully picked up on the fact that in order to build trustworthy models that use meaningful features to arrive at robust conclusions, it is necessary to combine ML with some domain knowledge and understanding of the business problems, what is then often referred to as Data Science:</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">[Step 1] Start with small pilot projects to understand the potential and challenges of using ML</dt>
<dd>
<p>Machine learning projects are unlike traditional software projects, where you&#8217;re usually certain that a solution at least exists and you only need to figure out an efficient way to get there. Instead, ML heavily relies on the available data. Even though it might theoretically be possible to solve your problem with ML, this might not be the case with the data you have at hand.
Before implementing some big AI initiative spanning the whole company, it is therefore strongly recommended that you start with several smaller pilot projects in order to get a better feeling for what it means to rely on an AI to solve your problems.<br>
When choosing a pilot project, the most important factor is not the Return on Investment (ROI) of the project, since here the experience with ML gained along the way should be the priority. However, it is important to choose a project that is <strong>technically feasible</strong>, i.e., which can be solved with existing ML algorithms and you don&#8217;t need years of research to develop your own fancy neural network architecture. Furthermore, you should have enough high-quality <strong>data available</strong> to get started, so you don&#8217;t spend months just on data preprocessing, e.g., due to the need to combine data from different sources within a poor data infrastructure.<br>
If you do not yet have the necessary AI talent in-house to tackle such a project, you can also partner with external consultants, which provide the ML expertise, while you supply the subject matter expertise to ensure the pilot project is a success.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[Step 2] Set up a centralized AI team and data infrastructure to carry out bigger projects efficiently and effectively</dt>
<dd>
<p>We&#8217;ve already seen that in practice, it&#8217;s really about the intersection of Theory, Programming, and Domain Knowledge, i.e., Data Science. However, it is unlikely that you&#8217;ll find a single person that is truly competent in all three areas. Instead, people will always have a certain focus and we therefore propose three distinct roles, which also align very well with the three main steps for successfully executing an ML project:</p>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/01b_intro_ml/venn7.png" alt="image" width="680">
</div>
<div class="title"><span class="small">While Data Strategists work in their respective departments to identify suitable problems that can benefit from ML, Data Scientist can experiment and develop prototypical solutions to these problems, which Data &amp; ML Engineers then get ready for production.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally, data scientists and engineers should be in their own separate team (i.e., the &#8220;AI Team&#8221;) and work on projects from different departments like an in-house consultancy:</p>

<div class="title"><span class="small">[Adapted from: &#8220;AI for everyone&#8221; by Andrew Ng (coursera.org)]</span></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This has several advantages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data scientists can discuss solutions with other ML experts &#8594; many problems will be similar from an algorithmic standpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine data from the whole company for a holistic analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding independent from individual business unit, e.g., necessary for the up front investment in data infrastructure, time required to keep up with new research, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we&#8217;ve discussed in the introduction, about 90% of the time in an ML project is spent on data wrangling. Therefore, especially in the beginning, <strong>the AI team should contain more Data Engineers than Data Scientists</strong>, so they can build a solid data infrastructure, which will save Data Scientists lots of time and headaches later.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[Step 3] Train other employees to recognize ML problems and establish a data-driven culture</dt>
<dd>
<p>While data scientists need to be intimately familiar with the algorithms they are using, other employees, especially data strategists and department leaders, should have some basic understanding of what ML is and is not capable of, such that they can identify possible ML problems and refer them to the AI team.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">[Step 4] Devise a cohesive strategy with long-term goals that result in a competitive advantage</dt>
<dd>
<p>Developing a strategy might be the first impulse of an executive when confronted with a new topic such as AI. However, since AI problems are so different from other kinds of projects, it really pays off to first gain some experience with this topic (i.e., start with step 1!). After you&#8217;ve successfully completed some pilot projects and set the wheels in motion to create an AI team as well as educate the other employees to get them on board, here are a few things to consider w.r.t. a companywide strategy to give you an advantage over your competition:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create strategic data assets that are hard for your competition to replicate:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Long-term planning: Which data might be valuable in the future? &#8594; Start collecting it now!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up-front investments: What infrastructure and processes are needed to make the data accessible to the right people?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you combine data from different divisions to enable the AI team to &#8220;connect the dots&#8221; and gain a unique edge over the competition?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What options do you have in terms of strategic data acquisition, e.g., in the form of &#8216;free&#8217; products, where users pay with their data (like what Google, Facebook, etc. are doing)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build AI-powered features that are a unique selling point for your products:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to recreate some off-the-shelf service that could be easily procured from an outside vendor, but use ML together with your unique subject matter expertise and data to build new features for your existing products to make them more appealing to your customers or open up new market segments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you establish a virtuous cycle, where your AI attracts more users, which in turn generate more data, which can then be used to train the AI to become even better and thereby attracts even more users?</p>

</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[Step 5] Communicate your success</dt>
<dd>
<p>After successfully implementing AI within the company, you should of course communicate your accomplishments. In addition to internal and external press releases, this also includes, for example, job listings, which will attract more qualified candidates if they are formulated from an informed standpoint instead of listing buzzwords.</p>
