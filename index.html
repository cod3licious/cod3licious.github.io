<p><strong>I help software organizations increase developer productivity and engagement by streamlining internal structures and processes.</strong>
Many companies struggle with inefficiencies that slow them down—whether due to misaligned team structures, tightly coupled software architecture, or processes that create unnecessary friction. Take a monolithic codebase: while perfect for early prototyping and finding product-market fit, it can become a major bottleneck as your organization grows, slowing progress and frustrating developers.</p>

<div>Common signs your company might be struggling with inefficiencies include:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Too many meetings.</strong> When software architecture is tightly coupled, teams can't work autonomously, leading to growing communication and coordination overhead.</li>
  <li><strong>Slow feature delivery.</strong> As technical debt piles up, even small changes become increasingly cumbersome.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer churn.</strong> Talented team members become disengaged and quit when inefficient processes prevent them from doing their best work.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Addressing these inefficiencies requires a <em>holistic approach</em> that aligns your software architecture with your team structures—<strong><a href="./talks/refactoring_sociotechnical_systems.pdf" target="_blank">refactoring the socio-technical system</a></strong>. To accomplish this, an outside perspective often helps to see the big picture and tackle problems at their root. I help organizations <strong>reduce friction and increase flow</strong> by applying principles like <em>domain-driven design</em> and restructuring work so <em>teams own end-to-end value streams</em>.</p>

<div>This transformation creates lasting impact:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Increased productivity.</strong> Independent teams move faster with minimal coordination overhead.</li>
  <li><strong>Better code quality.</strong> Clear boundaries result in more maintainable, reliable systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Higher team satisfaction.</strong> Developers feel empowered when they have full ownership of their domains.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster onboarding.</strong> New team members can understand and contribute to the codebase more quickly.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>My goal is to support your company in a sustainable way, empowering your teams to succeed long-term. I aim to make myself obsolete by addressing issues at the system level and creating structures that support continuous improvement.</p>

<h3>What I Offer</h3>

<p>You can engage my services in two ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>System Audit:</strong> Identify opportunities for improvement.</li>
  <li><strong>Fractional Tech Lead:</strong> Hands-on implementation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>System Audit: <em>Identify what should be done</em></h4>

<p>I'll assess your codebase and its surrounding socio-technical system to uncover areas for improvement. Together, we'll prioritize these findings into a <em>refactoring roadmap</em> with small, actionable steps your team can implement alongside feature development.</p>

<h4>Fractional Tech Lead: <em>Doing the work</em></h4>

<div>As a temporary staff engineer embedded in your team, I can:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Refactor code, structures, and processes</strong> to boost efficiency and quality.</li>
  <li>Offer guidance on <strong>architectural decisions</strong> and conduct <strong>code reviews</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Mentor junior developers</strong> to level up your team's capabilities.</li>
  <li>Provide hands-on implementation support, primarily using Python:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Build data-heavy apps, interactive dashboards, or ML-powered tools tailored to user needs.</li>
    <li><strong>MLOps:</strong> Take machine learning models from notebooks to production, with pipelines for monitoring and automated retraining.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Science:</strong> Unlock insights from your data, especially for predictive modeling with tabular or time-series data.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
