<section id="creating-shared-understanding" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-shared-understanding">Creating Shared Understanding</h2>
<p>Organizations run on <strong>processes</strong>. Most of them are messy, span multiple roles, combine human judgment with software automation, and exist partly in people’s heads. Improving these processes—by simplifying them, automating parts of them, or supporting steps with software—<strong>requires a shared understanding</strong> of how they actually work today and how they should work in the future.</p>
<p>This is especially important when building software. Software does not exist in isolation: it is embedded in human workflows, exchanges data with other systems, depends on user inputs, and introduces new constraints. When developers, domain experts, and stakeholders carry different mental models of the same process, the result is friction, rework, and the classic “that’s not what I meant” conversation.</p>
<p>So this is where visual models come in: A <strong>diagram</strong> that depicts the sequence of steps over time and shows the interactions and handoffs between different actors provides far more clarity than a verbal description of a process.</p>
<p>The effect is even stronger when that diagram is created collaboratively. In a <strong>collaborative modeling</strong> (CoMo) session, the relevant people jointly build a visual model of the process, discuss it, and question it. The diagram becomes a shared thinking aid: assumptions are made explicit, gaps become visible, and the group gains a concrete reference point for reasoning about change.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-another-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-another-model">Why Another Model?</h2>
<p>Yes, there already exist <strong>plenty of modeling notations and workshop formats</strong> that have proven their value in many contexts (check out the book <a href="https://leanpub.com/visualcollaborationtools"><em>Visual Collaboration Tools</em></a> for an overview). This article is not an argument against any of these tools.</p>
<p>Still, despite being a great source of inspiration, somehow none of these methods felt exactly right for what I was trying to accomplish when creating the diagrams for <a href="https://franziskahorn.de/rsebook">my latest book</a>. So, just in case I’m not the only one out there yearning for an alternative approach, I wanted to share my notation and the ideas behind it in more detail.</p>
<section id="modeling-from-different-perspectives" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modeling-from-different-perspectives">Modeling from Different Perspectives</h4>
<p>Let’s start by acknowledging that <strong>systems can be modeled from different perspectives</strong> (<a href="#fig-system-perspectives" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>).</p>
<p>One perspective focuses on a system’s <strong>structure</strong>: how individual elements are organized and composed into larger subsystems, typically in a bottom-up manner. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cells → Organs → Human body</li>
<li>Employees → Teams → Departments → Company</li>
<li>Lines of code → Functions and classes → Modules (files and folders) → Repository or deployable service</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools such as <a href="https://github.com/ddd-crew/context-mapping"><em>Context Mapping</em></a> and the <a href="https://c4model.com/"><em>C4 Model</em></a> are well suited to describing this structural view of (software) systems.</p>
<p>Another perspective focuses on <strong>behavior</strong>: what the system does over time. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digesting food</li>
<li>Onboarding a new employee</li>
<li>A user interacting with a mobile app to accomplish a task</li>
</ul>
<p>These behaviors can be described as <strong>processes</strong>, which are the focus of this article.</p>
<p>Processes themselves can be examined at different levels of granularity. Here, we deliberately stay at a higher level of abstraction.<br>
Techniques such as <a href="https://cucumber.io/blog/bdd/example-mapping-introduction/"><em>Example Mapping</em></a> are better suited for zooming in further and uncovering the detailed business rules that govern individual steps.</p>

<section id="process-modeling" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="process-modeling">Process Modeling</h4>
<p>Existing tools to model processes all optimize for slightly different goals, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language"><em>UML</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation"><em>BPMN</em></a> are well-established standards for modeling software architectures and business processes. They allow for very detailed and precise diagrams, but their specialized notation often makes the resulting models difficult to grasp for non-experts. They were also primarily intended for documentation rather than collaborative exploration.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eventstorming.com/"><em>EventStorming</em></a> is a popular collaborative modeling technique that emphasizes accessibility by using plain-language domain events. It works particularly well for discovering domain concepts and behavior, especially in unfamiliar problem spaces. However, the initial chaotic exploration phase can quickly become visually overwhelming, and as more structure and technical details are added, the resulting model often becomes difficult to follow. Additionally, expressing events in the past tense is unintuitive for many participants.</li>
<li><a href="https://domainstorytelling.org/"><em>Domain Storytelling</em></a> focuses on interactions between actors and objects and produces diagrams that are easy to understand and discuss. While effective for creating a shared overview, the temporal sequence of a process is represented indirectly through numbered arrows, which can make it harder to perceive the overall flow at a glance in more complex scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>InterAction Flow Mapping</strong> is not supposed to replace these approaches. Instead, it fills a specific gap by combining the simplicity of Domain Storytelling with the precision of UML:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple diagram that is <strong>easy to understand</strong>, even for non-technical domain experts.</li>
<li>A clear view of the <strong>process over time</strong>, with explicit separation of the <strong>different actors involved</strong>.</li>
<li>A notation that supports <strong>direct translation of the modeled process into a software implementation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The technique that comes closest to InterAction Flow Mapping is <a href="https://eventmodeling.org/posts/what-is-event-modeling/"><em>Event Modeling</em></a>. It visualizes wireframes alongside read and write operations that aggregate event-based data from multiple sources. The resulting diagrams are easy for domain experts to follow while still providing a rough implementation blueprint for developers. In practice, however, I found these models map more naturally to event-sourced architectures and often require an extra translation step when implementing a process with a simpler design based on relational databases.</p>

<section id="the-interaction-flow-notation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-interaction-flow-notation">The InterAction Flow Notation</h2>
<p>An <strong>InterAction Flow</strong> models a process as a <strong>sequence of interactions between actors</strong>. It can be used to visualize both analog processes as well as software behavior.</p>
<p>The modeling canvas is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>horizontal axis</strong> represents <strong>time</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>vertical axis</strong> represents <strong>actors in swimlanes</strong>—typically starting with a user or customer at the top (who initiates the process), followed by software modules or organizational units, and ending with data stores or records at the bottom.</li>
</ul>
<p>The visual elements are intentionally minimal (<a href="#fig-legend" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action boxes</strong> describe what an actor does, labeled with a short phrase in present tense starting with a verb (e.g., <em>verify credentials</em>). These actions should be meaningful at the business level and plausibly map to a function, API endpoint, or responsibility in software.<br>
<strong>Start and end markers</strong> indicate where the process begins and terminates. These borrow from BPMN but are optional—feel free to use normal stickies in a CoMo session.</li>
<li><strong>Arrows</strong> connect actions across swimlanes and are labeled with the <strong>information being exchanged</strong>. In software terms, these often correspond to input parameters and return values.</li>
<li><strong>Resource icons</strong> indicate where data is read or written during an action.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>

Not all arrows are annotated with exchanged information: some operations require no additional input (e.g., a GET request without parameters), while other information is transmitted indirectly, such as via the rendered web page.

Figure&nbsp;5: Process excerpt showing a conversation with an AI agent, with the goal of finding a hotel room: the user submits a prompt; the Large Language Model (LLM) powering the agent analyzes it, determines which tools to use to gather the required information, calls those tools (in this case, an external API for hotel search available via MCP), and then synthesizes a response from the results. Since this process step is more complex, it makes sense to spell out the individual subactions explicitly—while avoiding too much detail, so the overall process still remains understandable at a high level. In addition to the final output, the LLM also provides updates (explaining its “thinking”), which do not result in a user action.

<p>If you feel compelled to add conditionals or loops to your flow, this is a signal to pause and reconsider the level of abstraction. A lot of branching behavior happens <em>inside</em> an action and does not need to be visible at the overview level.<br>
When branching paths are central to the discussion, <strong>start by modeling the happy path</strong> and add annotations where alternatives exist, or create a separate diagram that starts at the branching point to explore the alternative flow.</p>

<p>InterAction Flows translate naturally into software design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Action boxes often map directly to function calls or API endpoints.</li>
<li>Arrow labels make the required data contracts explicit.</li>
<li>Swimlanes highlight ownership and boundaries between systems or teams.</li>

<p>When co-creating an InterAction Flow in a collaborative InterAction Flow Mapping session, it often makes sense to keep the diagram more abstract, as shown in the previous figures.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interaction-flow-mapping-workshops">InterAction Flow Mapping Workshops</h2>
<p>I propose two formats for InterAction Flow Mapping workshops, tailored to two common goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>designing a new (to-be) process, or</li>
<li>improving an existing (as-is) process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both workshops can be run in-person or remotely<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Feel free to adapt these workshop formats to your needs!</p>

<section id="running-the-workshop" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="running-the-workshop">Running the Workshop</h5>
<p>Depending on how complex the process is, this workshop might take a full day or you can split it over multiple sessions.</p>
<p>Main workshop steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Introduce goal and notation:</strong> Clarify (again) which process will be modeled and briefly explain the InterAction Flow elements if participants are unfamiliar with them.</li>
<li><strong>Braindrawing (together, alone):</strong> Give participants 5–10 minutes to independently sketch the process from their perspective, focusing on actors and their actions.<br>

<ul>
<li>For in-person sessions, provide paper and pencils; for remote sessions, prepare an individual whiteboard frame with example elements for each participant.</li>
<li>A useful approach is to start with user interactions and then move on to refining the required data, its sources, and persistence.</li>
<li>When redesigning an existing process, participants should try to ignore current constraints and design an ideal target process from scratch.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gallery walk:</strong> Allow time for participants to review each other’s diagrams.</li>
<li><strong>Select a starting point:</strong> Choose one diagram as the basis for the shared InterAction Flow—preferably via dot voting during the gallery walk, or by facilitator choice if time is limited.</li>
<li><strong>Incremental refinement:</strong> Starting with the author of the selected diagram, participants take turns explaining their view while the group incrementally refines the shared InterAction Flow based on the new perspective.</li>
<li><strong>[Optional] Compare with the as-is process:</strong> When redesigning an existing process, compare the new flow with the current-state diagram (including any identified pain points) to ensure no key steps are missing and major issues are addressed.<br>
For software-based processes, proceed by defining a <strong>refactoring plan with iterative improvements</strong> that gradually move the current process toward the target state, rather than attempting to implement a new flow from scratch while maintaining the existing one in parallel until a full replacement is possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>For software projects, the InterAction Flow can be refined further to aid the implementation (as in <a href="#fig-hotel-software-details" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a>) by splitting into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group 1 (incl.&nbsp;a UX Designer / Product Owner, Frontend Developer):</strong> Refines user interactions, adds wireframes, and identifies data needed to render the UI.</li>
<li><strong>Group 2 (incl.&nbsp;a Backend Developer):</strong> Refines API and data store layers, including database schemas or ORMs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be done in breakout sessions or asynchronously. The groups then reconvene to align their results and ensure the overall flow remains consistent and data needs are met end to end. At this point it can also be helpful to perform a <em>Data Completeness Check</em>.</p>

<p>An interesting concept in Event Modeling is the <strong>Data Completeness Check</strong>: Each dynamic element in a wireframe is highlighted in a specific color to indicate whether the data shown there needs to be retrieved from (green) or persisted in (blue) a data store.

<p>Since here the focus is on identifying problems rather than creating a new process, preparing the InterAction Flow is less of a creative exercise and can often be done in advance.

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Align on the InterAction Flow:</strong> Walk participants through the diagram and refine it collaboratively.</li>
