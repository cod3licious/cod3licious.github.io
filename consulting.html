<h2 id="consulting">Consulting</h2>
<p>As an organization, your main purpose is <strong>delivering value to customers‚Äîefficiently and effectively.</strong> Whether it's fixing a minor bug or launching a major new feature, how quickly you can deliver these changes matters. A lot.</p>

<p>However, the very system in which this work takes place‚Äîyour organization's structure, team dynamics, and codebase‚Äîcan often <strong>create friction and impede flow.</strong> Furthermore, when people lack focus and clarity on how their contributions benefit end users, personal goals (like seeking power or a promotion) can overshadow the shared purpose of delivering value. The result? A political culture where customers are left out in the cold.</p>

<h5>Tackling Problems at Their Root</h5>

<p>To avoid these pitfalls, you must address problems at the <strong>system level</strong>. Over the past decades, movements like Lean, Agile, and DevOps have driven significant progress. Many organizations now embrace practices aimed at reducing friction and improving flow:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Work in Cross-Functional Teams:</strong> Instead of handing work off from one silo to the next (e.g., product management, design, engineering, QA), cross-functional teams collaborate to deliver value end-to-end. This setup reduces communication overhead, aligns solutions more closely with customer needs, and improves engagement as team members see their direct impact.</li>
  <li><strong>Align Teams with OKRs:</strong> Objectives and Key Results or similar frameworks provide a <em>north star</em>, helping teams focus on what truly matters and pull together. While the theory is sound, many companies unfortunately miss the mark‚Äîwith eight new top priorities, what you've really gained is more meetings, not clarity.</li>
  <li><strong>Adopt Continuous Delivery:</strong> Releasing small, incremental changes (ideally in less than a day) allows work to be integrated continuously with the existing codebase. Automated testing and deployment make frequent releases painless, which, in turn, enables faster customer feedback and therefore better products.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce Technical Debt:</strong> It's widely understood that the shortcuts you took to meet a deadline eventually come back to bite you. Many teams now allocate time for refactoring and reducing technical debt. That said, efforts can sometimes go astray when developers prefer to ‚Äúburn it all down and start fresh‚Äù rather than making targeted improvements that speed up feature delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>Hold Regular Retrospectives:</strong> Encourage teams to reflect on successes, challenges, and areas for improvement. Creating <em>psychological safety</em> is key here to make sure everyone feels comfortable sharing openly without fear of blame. Over time, these reflections help teams spot patterns, adapt, and work toward <em>operational excellence</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Growth Brings New Challenges</h5>

<p>While these practices are invaluable, their <strong>success depends on your organization's unique context</strong>. And growth‚Äîe.g., scaling from 10 to 50 people or from 50 to 250‚Äîoften exposes new challenges.</p>

<p>For instance, a monolithic codebase may have helped a small team quickly ship a prototype to find product-market fit. But as you grow into multiple teams, this same codebase can cause bottlenecks. As teams step on each other's toes, delivery slowly grinds to a halt and you're left with developers that are frustrated and disengaged.</p>

<h5>A Holistic Approach to Scaling</h5>

<p>To <strong>scale effectively</strong>, you need a <strong>holistic approach</strong> that considers your entire socio-technical system‚Äîhow team processes and software architecture intersect. Applying principles like <strong>domain-driven design</strong> and structuring work so that each team owns an end-to-end value stream can drive improvements.</p>

<p>However, this is not an easy feat, especially if ‚Äúrising from the ashes‚Äù is not a luxury you're willing to afford. So this is where I come in. üòä</p>

<h3>What I offer</h3>

<p>My mission is to support your organization in a <strong>sustainable way, ensuring long-term success</strong>. I strive to empower your teams and make myself obsolete by solving problems at the system level, thereby creating self-reinforcing structures that promote continuous improvement.</p>

<h4>System Audit</h4>

<p>In a system audit, I thoroughly <strong>examine your codebase and the surrounding socio-technical system</strong> to identify opportunities for improvement. Together with your team, we prioritize these findings to create a <strong>refactoring roadmap</strong> with <strong>small, actionable steps</strong> that can be implemented alongside ongoing feature development.</p>

<h4>Fractional Tech Lead  </h4>

<div>As a temporary staff engineer embedded in your team, I can:
<ul>
  <li>Advise on <strong>architectural decisions</strong> and conduct <strong>code reviews</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Refactor code and processes</strong> to improve team efficiency and code quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Mentor junior developers</strong> to level up your team's capabilities.</li>
  <li>Offer <strong>hands-on implementation support</strong>, primarily using Python:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Building data-heavy apps, interactive dashboards, and ML-powered tools, including data visualizations that meet real user needs.</li>
    <li><strong>MLOps:</strong> Taking models from notebooks to production, building monitoring pipelines, and automating retraining workflows.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve Model Accuracy:</strong> Diving deep into your data to unlock its predictive power, particularly with tabular or time-series data (e.g., sensor measurements).</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
