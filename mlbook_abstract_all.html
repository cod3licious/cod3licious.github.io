<p><strong>Why read this book?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a lot of machine learning (ML) resources out there. Many of them either targeted at students or researchers and rather heavy on the mathematical theory, or others in the form of tutorials, focusing on the concrete implementation and application of some ML algorithm to a specific problem. This book tries to find a middle ground between both the theoretical background, which I have studied in depth while completing my PhD in machine learning at the TU Berlin, Germany, and the practical applications of these algorithms to solve different problems, as I have been doing in the last few years as an independent data science consultant for various firms. This book originated from my experience holding dozens of machine learning seminars and workshops in front of audiences with varying levels of technical and mathematical background.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Questions this book answers:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which problems can machine learning (ML) solve?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does ML solve these problems, i.e., how do the algorithms work (in theory)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you actually get this to work in practice and avoid common pitfalls?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book does <strong>not</strong> explain the latest fancy neural network model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on some specific task. Rather it is meant to provide a general intuition for the ideas behind different machine learning algorithms to establish a solid framework that helps you better understand and integrate into a bigger picture what you later read about these specific approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book and the associated courses exist in two versions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the full version, targeted at (about to be) data scientists: [<a href="https://franziskahorn.de/mlbook/">book</a>][<a href="https://franziskahorn.de/mlws_scientist.html">course</a>]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the condensed version, targeted at a more general audience: [<a href="https://franziskahorn.de/mlbook_abstract/">book</a>][<a href="https://franziskahorn.de/mlws_strategist.html">course</a>] (also available in German: [<a href="https://franziskahorn.de/mlbuch_auszug/">book</a>][<a href="https://franziskahorn.de/mlws_strategist_de.html">course</a>])</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The condensed version is written for all audiences, i.e., readers generally interested in ML, who want to understand what is behind the hype and where ML can (or should not) be used. The full version is mainly written for ML practitioners and assumes the reader is familiar with elementary concepts of linear algebra (see also this <a href="https://franziskahorn.de/mlws_resources/math_basics.pdf" target="\_blank">overview on the mathematical notation</a> used in the book).</p>

<p><strong>Face recognition</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Face recognition technology is one of the earliest notable examples of machine learning and computer vision that can nowadays be found in every digital camera and smartphone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the algorithms implemented in a camera application are fairly simple and only detect the presence of faces in general to make sure you look your best when the picture is taken, more sophisticated algorithms are also being used by governments and law enforcement in more and more countries to match a detected face to a known person in their biometric databases, for example, to identify criminals. So&#8230;&#8203;smile!?</p>

<p><strong>Analysis of medical images</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last example on image data comes from the application area of medicine: Below you see two images of retinas, i.e., photos taken of the back of someone&#8217;s eye, based on which it is possible to diagnose a common complication of diabetes that can result in blindness if left untreated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diagnostic algorithm to identify the markers of the disease in these images was developed by researchers at Google and achieves the same level of accuracy as human experts in the field. Google had even assembled a team of top specialists to discuss the hardest cases again to get consistent labels for all images, which gave their model an additional performance boost. Since the equipment to take these images is fairly cheap, this means that with this ML model, expert diagnostic decisions can now be made available to those that might otherwise not have had the means to consult a top specialist.</p>

<p>Leaving the field of computer vision, now an example from the area of natural language processing (NLP): Conversational agents, like Siri or Alexa, are waiting for commands in many people&#8217;s homes. While the answers they give are mostly still scripted by humans (as in the screenshot below), the real challenge is to understand what the person had actually said in the first place. Speech recognition, i.e., automatically transcribing spoken language into text, is a rather difficult problem, for example, since people speak with different accents and there can be additional background noises.</p>

<p>Again from the field of NLP: machine translation, i.e., automatically translating text from one language into another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have used Google Translate (shown as an example in the screenshot below) after it was first released in 2006, you were probably often quite disappointed with the results, as the translated sentences read more like the words were just looked up one after another in a dictionary (= statistical machine translation). However, this changed when Google made the switch to a neural network model to generate the translations 10 years later in 2016: now the translated texts are actually readable and usually require only minor manual corrections, if any.</p>

<p><strong>Recommender systems</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another application area are recommender systems, e.g., on e-commerce platforms like Amazon in the screenshot below, which (ideally) provide the user with helpful search results and suggestions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and thereby generate revenue for the respective companies. They are also used on social media platforms and by Netflix, YouTube &amp; co to keep you glued to your screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes the provided suggestions might help you find exactly what you were looking for. But especially platforms with uncurated content such as YouTube have also been criticized for fostering, e.g., conspiracy theories through these personalized recommendations. Since this kind of content kept users especially engaged, it was recommended a lot and thereby drove the users further down some rabbit hole instead of also providing perspectives outside one&#8217;s own information bubble.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But on the upside, the research on recommender systems has also sparked developments in other areas of science, such as methods that recommend drug molecules that fit to the proteins playing a key role in certain diseases to accelerate the search for a cure.</p>

<p><strong>Better than humans: AlphaGo</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2016, DeepMind, a startup subsequently acquired by Google, presented AlphaGo, the first computer program to beat a human Go master.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was a huge milestone for the AI research community, as Go, with a 19 x 19 playing field, is a lot more complex than chess (8 x 8 tiles and more restrictive movement patterns), and even the most optimistic AI researchers had not expected that a computer could win against a Go master before 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Protein folding - solving a 50-year-old challenge</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>DeepMind presented another major success story in 2020: Their AlphaFold model now estimates the 3D structure of a protein from its raw amino acid sequence as accurately as traditional simulation models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proteins often play a key role in diseases. If we know a protein&#8217;s 3D structure, we can determine which drug molecules can bind to it and thereby identify target structures that should be investigated further to find a cure for the disease.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While exact simulation models to estimate a protein&#8217;s 3D structure existed for a long time, these were very slow and it often took several days to compute the folding for a single protein. With the new neural network model, the same computation can now be done in a matter of minutes or even seconds, thereby vastly accelerating drug development.</p>

<h3 id="_ml_history_why_now">ML history: Why now?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why is there such a rise in ML applications now?
Not only in our everyday lives has ML become omnipresent, but also the number of research paper published each year has increased exponentially over the last few years:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, interestingly, this is not due to an abundance of groundbreaking theoretical accomplishments in the last few years (indicated as purple diamonds in the plot), but rather many of the algorithms used today were actually developed as far back as the late 50s / early 60s (e.g., the perceptron is the earliest version of a neural network model, which are behind all the examples shown above). Indeed, the most important neural network architectures, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), which provide the foundation for state-of-the-art language and image processing respectively, were developed in the early 80s and 90s, but back then, we simply didn&#8217;t have the computational resources available to use them on anything more than small toy datasets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, the rise in ML publications correlates more closely with the number of transistors on CPUs (i.e., the regular processors in normal computers) and GPUs (graphics cards, which parallelize the kinds of computations needed to train neural network models efficiently):</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the release of many open source libraries, such as scikit-learn (for traditional ML models) and theano, tensorflow, and (py)torch (for the implementation of neural networks), has further facilitated the use of ML algorithms in many different fields.</p>

While these libraries somewhat democratize the use of ML, unfortunately, this also brings with it the downside that ML is now often applied by many who might not fully understand the theoretical underpinnings of these algorithms or the assumptions they make about the data that they are being applied to. This can, in the best case, result in models that don&#8217;t show the expected performance and subsequently maybe some (misplaced) disappointment in ML, and, in the worst case, lead to models that discriminate against certain parts of the population, e.g., credit scoring algorithms used by banks that systematically give women loans at higher interest rates than men due to biases encoded in the historic data used to train the models. We&#8217;ll discuss these kinds of issues in more detail in the chapter on avoiding common pitfalls.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An additional factor driving the spread of ML besides compute power is the availability of (digital) data. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook have had a head start here, as their business model was built around data from the start, but other companies are starting to catch up. While traditional ML models do not benefit much from all this available data, large neural network models with many degrees of freedom can now show their full potential by learning from basically all the texts and images posted every day on the Internet:</p>

Of course, one can pack several individual ANIs into one big program that solves multiple different tasks, but this collection of ANIs is still not able to learn (on its own) any new skills beyond these capabilities. Many AI researchers currently believe that we might never produce a true human-like AGI.</p>

<p>OK, so machine learning is already transforming all of our lives and you should probably know something about it. So now what exactly is ML?</p>

Simply speaking, an <strong>algorithm</strong> can be thought of as a specific <strong>strategy or recipe for solving a certain kind of problem</strong>. For example, there exist effective algorithms to find the shortest paths between two cities (e.g., what Google Maps uses when you ask for directions) or to solve scheduling problems (which task should be done first and which task after that to finish all tasks before their respective deadlines and satisfy dependencies between the tasks). Machine learning deals with the subset of algorithms that detect and make use of statistical regularities in a dataset to obtain specific results.

ML itself can be subdivided into 3 main subfields, unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning, and another recent buzzword, &#8220;deep learning&#8221;, which just refers to all methods using neural networks. Some of the simplest algorithms used in ML, like linear regression or PCA (very similar to factor analysis), are also used by statisticians, who, however, additionally also use other tools, like hypothesis tests, which do not learn rules or patterns from data. Finally, most data scientists will use many tools from ML and statistics, but they as well use some additional tools like A/B tests (e.g., for checking whether a red or green &#8220;buy&#8221; button on a website generates more sales), which do not fall into any of the other categories.</span></div>

<h3 id="_how_do_machines_learn">How do machines &#8220;learn&#8221;?</h3>

<p>The set of ML algorithms can be further subdivided based on how they work, i.e., how they learn from the data. This is inspired by how humans learn:</p>

<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/01b_intro_ml/ml_algorithms_short_human4.png" alt="image" width="740">
</div>
<div class="title"><span class="small"><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Humans are very good at picking up on statistical regularities in the world without being explicitly instructed to do so. For example, have you ever noticed that we don&#8217;t &#8230;&#8203; make &#8230;&#8203; pauses &#8230;&#8203; between &#8230;&#8203; words when we speak? Yet kids still intuitively learn which syllables belong to the same words and where a word ends and the next one begins. This works because some syllables always occur in the specific combination making up a single word, while this word can then be followed by many different words, starting with many different syllables. This means, simply by hearing lots of spoken text, we pick up on the conditional probability distributions of syllables. <strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> This type of learning occurs when you have a teacher that tells you what the right answers are and corrects you if you get something wrong. For example, when teaching a kid the meaning of a word, you would explicitly tell them what this word means, and if they mislabel something, e.g., call a small dog a cat, you would correct them. <strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> This is another type of learning that happens naturally when humans learn from the consequences of their actions. For example, through experimentation and practice, we can figure out the complex sequence of hand movements that is necessary to elicit beautiful sounds from a violin instead of producing painful screeches. While no single hand movement by itself is inherently good or bad, only the right combination will bring music to our ears.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Analogously, machines can also learn by following these three strategies:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/01b_intro_ml/ml_algorithms_short4.png" alt="image" width="740">
</div>
<div class="title"><span class="small"><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Here the algorithms pick up on statistical regularities in the data, e.g., they can identify groups of similar items (like in the customer segmentation task) or find individual points that stand out (i.e., anomaly detection, for example, noticing when a machine shows some unusual behavior due to a broken part, or fraud detection like identifying suspicious credit card transactions). <strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Here the algorithms learn from many input-output examples (e.g., images and what is shown on these images, or production conditions and whether or not the product that was produced under these conditions was faulty or okay), so that in the future the model can produce the right output given some new input. <strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> This type of learning is a bit more involved: Here the learning algorithm is also called an agent, which operates inside an environment (either, e.g., a robot moving around in the real world, or a virtual agent inside a simulation environment like a video game (which is usually much cheaper ;-)). The environment lets the agent know in which state or situation it currently is, then the agent can select how to react in this state, i.e., which (predefined) action to take, and then the environment determines the consequences of this action (e.g., kill a monster in a video game or fall off a cliff) and returns a reward depending on the outcome (e.g., extra points for defeating an enemy). Then the cycle repeats as the agent is in the next state. Based on the received reward, the agent learns over time which actions are beneficial in which situations and how to navigate the environment. The hard part here is that the reward signals often come much later after the action was executed, for example, in a video game, the agent might collect a key somewhere at the beginning of a level, but the door that can be opened with this key might only come many frames later, which means the reward will be delayed and the agent will have a hard time associating this reward with the appropriate action. Since humans have a lot of background knowledge, figuring out what works and what doesn&#8217;t in a game is much easier for us.</span></div>

<p>With its reliance on a data-generating environment, reinforcement learning is a bit of a special case.

<p>It is important to keep in mind that unsupervised learning problems have no right or wrong answers. Unsupervised learning algorithms simply recognize patterns in the data, which may or may not be meaningful for us humans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, there exist a bunch of different unsupervised learning algorithms that group data points into clusters, each with a slightly different strategy and opinion on what it means for two samples to be similar enough that they can be put into the same cluster.</p>

<p>The available supervised learning algorithms differ in the <strong>type of \(x \to y\) relationship</strong> they can describe (e.g., linear or non-linear) and what kind of <strong>objective</strong> (also called loss function; an error computed on the training data, quantifying the mismatch between true and predicted labels) they minimize. The task of a data scientist is to select the right type of model that can optimally fit the given data. The rest is then taken care of by an <strong>optimization method, which finds the parameters of the model that minimize the model&#8217;s objective</strong> (i.e., such that the model&#8217;s prediction error on the given data is as small as possible).</p>

In most of the book, the terms &#8220;ML algorithm&#8221; and &#8220;ML model&#8221; will be used interchangeably. To be more precise, however, in general the algorithm processes the data and learns some parameter values and these parameter settings then define the final model. (For example, a linear regression <em>model</em> is defined by its coefficients (i.e., the model&#8217;s parameters), which are found by doing some stuff with the data (i.e., executing the steps outlined in the linear regression <em>algorithm</em>, which includes solving an optimization problem).)

<p>While <strong>traditional software</strong> solutions are used to automate tasks that can be formulated as a fixed, predefined sequence of actions, executed according to some <strong>hard-coded rules</strong> (e.g., &#8220;a gate should open <em>if</em> an object passes through a photoelectric barrier and 20 seconds later the gate should close again&#8221;), machine learning can be used to <strong>automate &#8220;input &#8594; output&#8221; tasks</strong> for which it would otherwise be <strong>difficult to come up with such rules</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the quality control in a cookie factory is such an &#8220;input (cookie) &#8594; output (ok/defective)&#8221; task: While some broken cookies could be sorted out automatically by checking that each cookie weights around 15g, it would be difficult to formulate rules that reliably catch all possible defects. So either a human could watch the production line to additionally recognize, e.g., over-baked cookies, or one could take pictures of the cookies and use them as input for a machine learning model to recognize the defective cookies:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To solve this problem with ML, first a large dataset needs to be compiled with photos of many good, but also all kinds of defective cookies, including the corresponding annotations, i.e., a label for each picture whether it displays a good or defective cookie (not necessarily specifying the kind of defect). A ML algorithm can then learn to distinguish between good and defective cookies from these examples.</p>

<p>an exact simulation with a mechanistic model takes too long (but can be used to generate a high quality dataset). For example, the AlphaFold model shown in the first section, which is used to predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, can be trained on the data generated by the original simulation model used to solve this task before, but which was too slow to be applied to a large number of proteins.</p>

&#8594; humans are much better at generalizing from a few examples (e.g., a doctor can still easily recognize the disease even if the pictures were taken with a slightly different setup that might result, for example, in noisier images, while the ML model needs to be specifically trained for these cases, which means that in the worst case you might need to collect a lot of additional data for this new setup)</p>

</div>
<div class="title"><span class="small">The first idea is to automate the quality check that was so far done by a human: since the human can easily recognize the defects in the pictures taken of the products, a ML model should be able to do this, too. The next idea is to try to predict in advance whether a product will be faulty or not based on the composition of raw materials and the proposed process conditions: success here is unclear, since the human experts are not sure whether all of the information necessary to determine if the product will be fine is contained in this data (but nevertheless it&#8217;s worth a try since this could save lots of resources). While the final ML model that solves the input-output problem can be deployed as software in the ongoing process, when a data scientist analyzes the results and interprets the model, she can additionally generate insights that can be translated into action recommendations.</span></div>

<li>
<p>Prioritize: which project will have a high impact, but at the same time also a good chance of success, i.e., should yield a high return on investment (ROI)? For example, using ML to automate a simple task is a comparatively low risk investment, but might cause some assembly-line workers to loose their (possibly quite boring) jobs. In contrast, identifying the root causes of why a production process results in 10% scrap could save millions, but it is not clear from the start that such an analysis will actually yield useful results, since the collected data on the process conditions might not be sufficient, i.e., might not contain all the needed information.</p>

&#8658; <strong>Ask a domain expert</strong> whether she thinks all the relevant input data is available to compute the desired output (this is usually easy to determine for unstructured data such as images (if a human can see the thing in the image, ML should too), but harder for structured data, such as a spreadsheets with hundreds of columns of sensor measurements)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a suitable &#8220;input &#8594; output&#8221; problem as been identified, <strong>historic data needs to be gathered and the right ML algorithm needs to be selected and applied</strong> to obtain a working solution. This is what the next chapters are all about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the prototypical solution has been implemented and meets the required performance level, this solution then has to be deployed, i.e., <strong>integrated into the general workflow and infrastructure</strong> so that it can actually be used to improve the respective process in practice (as a piece of software that continuously makes predictions for new data points). There are generally two strategies for how to do this:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The ML model runs on the &#8220;edge&#8221;, i.e., on each individual machine where the respective data is collected and the output of the model is used in subsequent process steps. This is often the best strategy when the results need to be computed in real time and / or a continuous Internet connection can not be guaranteed, e.g., in self-driving cars. However, the downside of this is that, depending on the type of ML model, comparatively expensive computing equipment needs to be installed in each machine, e.g., GPUs for neural network models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ML model runs in the &#8220;cloud&#8221;, i.e., on a central server, e.g., in the form of a web application that receives the data from the individual users, processes it, and sends back the results. This is often the more efficient solution if a response in near real time is sufficient for the respective use case, but can bring with it privacy concerns if personal information is processed. One of the major benefits of this solution is that it is easier to update the ML model, for example, when more historic data becomes available or if the process changes and the model now has to deal with slightly different inputs (we&#8217;ll discuss this further in the section on messy data).</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at the second main step, &#8220;devise a working solution&#8221;, in more detail. To solve a concrete problem using ML, you will generally follow this workflow:</p>

</div>
<div class="title"><span class="small">You always start with some kind of question or problem that should be solved with ML. And to solve it, you need data, which you most likely will have to clean a bit before you can start working with it (e.g., merge different excel files, fix missing values, etc.). Then it&#8217;s time for an exploratory analysis to better understand what you&#8217;re dealing with. Depending on the type of data, you might also need to extract appropriate features or maybe engineer additional ones (for which domain knowledge will be very helpful). All these steps are grouped under "preprocessing" <em>(red box)</em> and the bubbles are arranged in zigzag, because often you find yourself jumping back and forth between these steps (e.g., by visualizing the dataset, you might realize that you have some outliers that you want to remove, or after engineering new features, you go back and visualize the dataset again). Next comes the ML part <em>(green box)</em>: you&#8217;ll probably start with some simple model, evaluate it, try a more complex model, experiment with different hyperparameters, &#8230;&#8203; and at some point realize, that you&#8217;ve exhausted your ML toolbox and are still not happy with the performance. This means you need to go back and either engineer better features or, if this also doesn&#8217;t help, even collect more and/or better data (e.g., more samples, data from additional sensors, cleaner labels, etc.). Finally, when you&#8217;re confident in the model&#8217;s predictions, there are two routes you might take: either the data science route, where you communicate your findings to the stakeholders (which will most likely result in further questions), or the ML-software route, where the final model is deployed somewhere in production (where you mustn&#8217;t forget to monitor the model&#8217;s performance and collect new data such that the model can continuously be improved, especially as the inevitable data or concept drifts occur). Working on a machine learning project is a very iterative process.</span></div>

<p>Unfortunately, due to a lack of standardized data infrastructure in many companies, the sad truth is that usually (at least) about 90% of a Data Scientist&#8217;s time will be spent collecting, cleaning, and otherwise preprocessing the data to get it into a format where the ML algorithms can be applied:</p>

<p>For example, a production process, where you want to predict whether a produced part will be scrap given certain production conditions, would be a typical supervised learning problem. Here, the collected data for each produced part should include the process conditions under which it was produced, as well as the outcome (i.e., product was okay or scrap):</p>

Here we distinguish between <em>features</em> (in this case the production conditions) and <em>labels</em> (whether the product produced under these conditions was okay or scrap). Features, also denoted as a matrix \(X\), are typically those measurements that we get basically for free, as they are often collected during the process for other purposes anyways (e.g., when the operator of the machine sets the temperature for the production to a certain value, this is recorded as the signal is passed along to the heating unit). The corresponding labels, denoted as a vector \(\mathbf{y}\), are often more expensive to collect. (For example, in the production process, to collect a data point with the label <em>"scrap"</em>, we have to (intentionally) produce a broken product that we can&#8217;t sell afterwards, costing us valuable resources. Another example would be when Google paid a team of specialist doctors to discuss and re-label some of the diabetic retinopathy images about which there existed conflicting opinions.) In the supervised learning setup, the features are used as the input to the model, while the labels constitute the target variable, i.e., the predicted output. Generally, features should be independent variables (e.g., settings that the operator can choose as he wishes), while the target value should be dependent on these inputs (otherwise we can&#8217;t predict it).</span></div>

Structured data is often <em>heterogeneous</em>, since the different variables in a dataset typically stand for very different things (e.g., when working with sensor data you normally would not have a dataset that only contains temperature measurements, but additionally it might contain, e.g., pressure and flow values, which have different units and might be on very different scales). Unstructured data, on the other hand, is <em>homogeneous</em> (e.g., there is no qualitative difference between the 10th and the 100th pixel in an image).</span></div>

&#8658; clean up the data by relabeling (which can take some time but will pay off!&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;see also this great <a href="https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo" target="\_blank">MLOps / data-centric AI talk by Andrew Ng</a> on how a small high-quality dataset can be more valuable than a larger noisy dataset)</p>

&#8658; talk to a domain expert about which additional input features might be helpful and should be included in the dataset. <em>Worst case:</em> need to install a new sensor in the machine and collect this data, i.e., all the data collected in the past is basically useless.

<span class="small">In many applications, our first instinct might be to use a camera to generate the input data, since we humans rely primarily on our visual system to solve many tasks.

Trying to detect mushy strawberries? Use a near infrared (NIR) sensor instead of a regular camera like <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.co.uk/innovation/machine-learning-using-algorithms-to-sort-fruit" target="\_blank">Amazon Fresh</a> did. They still use machine learning to analyze the resulting data, but in the NIR images the rotting parts of fruits are more easily visible than in normal photos.<br>
Trying to detect if a door is closed?

If you can, observe how the data is being collected.

<div class="title"><span class="small">If your goal is to simply understand your dataset a bit better and get an overview of it, then a dimensionality reduction algorithm from the area of unsupervised learning can be used to create a visualization of the dataset. If you want to discover patterns in the data, then you would also choose an algorithm from the field of unsupervised learning, but here it depends on which kinds of patterns you want to find: anomaly detection algorithms can be used to identify individual data points that deviate a lot from the rest (e.g., a malfunctioning machine or a fraudulent credit card transaction), while clustering algorithms can be used to identify groups of similar data points (e.g., for customer segmentation). If your goal is to make specific predictions, i.e., given an input get a corresponding output (e.g., predict whether a product will be faulty if it is produced under certain conditions), then you need to use an algorithm from the area of supervised learning. Here the main distinction is made between regression and classification models: in regression tasks, the target variable that should be predicted is continuous (e.g., number of users, price, etc.), while in classification tasks the target variable is discrete, i.e., can only take on one distinct value and there is no continuum between the different values (e.g., an animal in a picture can either be a cat or a dog, but not something in between). While unsupervised and supervised learning cover most general use cases, there are also other algorithms for more specific applications, e.g., recommender systems.</span></div>

<div class="title"><span class="small">The first step when working with a new dataset is usually to visualize it, to get a better overview of all the samples and their diversity. This can be done with a dimensionality reduction algorithm, which takes the original high dimensional data as input (i.e., where each column (= feature) in the table would be one dimension) and outputs a lower dimensional representation of the samples, i.e., a new matrix with fewer columns (generally 2 for a visualization). These two new features, in our case here called \(z_1\) and \(z_2\), can now be used to create a scatter plot of the dataset (i.e., where each sample / row (in this case each apartment) is represented as one point using this new 2D coordinate system). You can think of this plot as a map of your dataset, that enables you to view all data points at a glance and where you can often see interesting patterns, for example, groups of similar points, which would be arranged close to each other in this 2D map. Please note that for most dimensionality reduction methods, it is not possible to describe what is behind this new coordinate system, specifically, these are not just the two most informative original features, but really completely new dimensions that summarize the information of the original inputs. To better interpret these plots, it is often helpful to color the dots afterwards by some variable, which can then reveal the driving factors behind the most salient patterns in the dataset (e.g., in this example we could have used the price of each apartment to color the respective dot in the map, which might then reveal that similarly priced apartments are arranged next to each other).</span></div>

<div class="title"><span class="small">In the next step, you would usually check your dataset for outliers (to then subsequently correct or remove these samples). An outlier detection algorithm outputs for each sample an anomaly score, which indicates whether this data point deviates from the norm. You can also use these scores then to colorize the 2D map of your dataset you generated in the previous step to see the anomalies in context. One drawback is that an anomaly detection algorithm does not tell you <em>why</em> it considers an individual point an outlier, i.e., a data scientist then needs to examine the points identified as outlier to see, e.g., if these should be removed due to flawed measurements or if they constitute some interesting edge cases. In this toy example, the sample identified as an anomaly is an apartment that supposedly has a size of only \(35 m^2\), but at the same time 5 bedrooms, i.e., here most likely the person that originally entered the data made a mistake and the size of the listing should actually be 135.</span></div>

<div class="title"><span class="small">Additionally, you might also want to check if the dataset contains naturally occurring groups. This can be accomplished with a clustering algorithm, which returns a cluster index for each sample, where points with the same index are in the same cluster. Please note that these cluster indices are not ordered and when running the algorithm again, the samples might be assigned different numbers, however, the groups of samples that were assigned the same number should still be in a cluster together, i.e., this cluster might now just be called &#8216;5&#8217; instead of &#8216;3&#8217;. Again you can use these cluster indices to colorize the 2D map of your dataset that you got from applying a dimensionality reduction method to see the clusters in context. While a clustering algorithm groups similar points together, it again does not tell you <em>why</em> the points were assigned to a cluster and what this cluster means, i.e., again the data scientist now needs to examine the results to try to describe the different clusters (e.g., in our toy example, the clusters might be &#8220;cheap studio apartments&#8221;, &#8220;large family apartments&#8221;, and &#8220;luxurious penthouses&#8221;).

Since the variable &#8220;sold&#8221; can only take on discrete values (i.e., yes (1) or no (0)), this is a (binary) classification problem. A classification model would then use the attributes of an apartment together with the listing&#8217;s price as an input and predict whether the apartment will be sold for this price. Since we also have the true labels available (at least for the initial dataset that we had collected), we can evaluate how well the model performed by computing how many wrong predictions it generated (this is the nice thing about supervised learning: we can always determine how good the solution is and benchmark different models against each other, while in unsupervised learning the data scientist needs to manually examine the results in detail to try to make sense of them).</span></div>

<div class="title"><span class="small">First, the smart speaker needs to know whether it was spoken to, i.e., activated with a specific trigger word (e.g., &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221;). This is a simple binary classification task (trigger word: yes/no), which is usually performed on the device itself, since you wouldn&#8217;t want the speaker to continuously stream everything you say into the cloud. Next, the spoken words that follow the trigger word are transcribed into text, since text is easier to handle, because, for example, variations due to different accents are removed. Then, based on this text, the intent is recognized, i.e., which of the different functionalities of the virtual assistant should be used (e.g., tell a joke, play music, set an alarm, etc.), which is a multi-class classification problem. The next step is then to actually execute the request, which is not done with ML, but instead some task-specific program is run, e.g., to select a joke from a database or set a timer, etc., based on the apps installed on the device. Finally, the output of the program needs to be converted into an audio signal again, where again an ML model can help to get smoothly spoken text (and in the near future maybe with the voice of Morgan Freeman or some other famous person like in "Deep Fake" applications).</span></div>

&#8658; It is generally advisable to first think about how your problem could be decomposed into easier-to-solve subproblems, especially since there might already be a large dataset or pre-trained ML model available for one of these subtasks (e.g., for speech recognition you could train a model on audio books and political speeches in addition to the data collected from your smart speaker users).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have an online shop and are trying to predict how much of a product you will sell in the next month. The price you are willing to sell the product for will obviously influence the demand, as people are trying to get a good deal, i.e., the lower the price, the higher the demand; a negative correlation that can be captured by a linear model. However, the demand will never be below zero (i.e., when the price is very high, people wont suddenly return the product), so we need to adapt the model such that the predicted output is never negative. This can be achieved by applying the max function, in this context also called a non-linear activation function, to the output of the linear model, so that now when the linear model would return a negative value, we instead predict 0.</p>
</div>

<div class="title"><span class="small">A very simple linear model with one input and one output variable and a non-linear activation function (the max function).</span></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Together, this functional relationship can be visualized as a circle with one input <em>(price)</em> and one output <em>(demand)</em>, where the incoming arrow represents the weight multiplied with the input feature and the S-curve in the circle indicates that a non-linear activation function is applied to the result. We will later see these circles as a single unit or &#8220;neuron&#8221; of a neural network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get better results, you can extend the model and use multiple input features for the prediction:</p>

<div class="title"><span class="small">A linear model with multiple inputs, where the prediction is computed as a weighted sum of the inputs, together with the max function to prevent negative values.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To further improve the performance, you could now manually construct more informative features from the original inputs by combining them in meaningful ways (&#8594; feature engineering) before computing the output:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/05_supervised_nn/neural_network_intuitive_b6.png" alt="image" width="540">
</div>
<div class="title"><span class="small">You can probably come up with a few more informative features, derived from the original input variables, to further improve the prediction accuracy. For example, since you&#8217;re running an online shop, the customers also have to pay shipping fees, which means to reflect the true affordability of the product, you actually need to combine the product price with the shipping costs. Next, the customers are interested in high quality products. However, not only the actual quality of the raw materials you used to make your product influences how your customers perceive the product, but you can also reinforce the impression that your product is of high quality with a marketing campaign. Furthermore, a high price also suggests that your product is superior. This means by creating these additional features, the price can actually contribute in two ways towards the final prediction: while, on the one hand, a lower price is beneficial for the affordability of the product, a higher price, on the other hand, will result in a larger perceived quality.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While in this toy example, it was possible to construct such features manually, the nice thing about neural networks is that they do exactly that automatically: By using multiple layers, i.e., stacking multiple linear models (with non-linear activation functions) on top of each other, it is possible to create more and more complex combinations of the original input features, which can improve the performance of the model. The more layers the network uses (i.e., the &#8220;deeper&#8221; it is), the more complex the resulting feature representations.</p>

This new vector is then multiplied by the second weight matrix \(W_2\) and again a non-linear activation function is applied to yield the second hidden layer representation of the sample, \(\mathbf{x}''\). Depending on how many layers the network has (i.e., how deep it is), this could be repeated multiple times now until finally the last layer computes the predicted output \(\mathbf{\hat{y}}\).

However, some problems do not fall into the category of simple supervised learning tasks (i.e., regression or classification), and require a different output. For example, in machine translation, the output should be the sentence translated into the other language, which can be achieved by coupling two RNNs: the first &#8216;understands&#8217; the sentence in the original language and this representation of the meaning of the sentence is then passed to a second RNN, which generates from it the translated sentence word by word. Another example would be the task of image captioning (i.e., generating text describing what can be seen on an image, e.g., to improve the online experience for the visually impaired), where first the image is &#8216;understood&#8217; by a CNN and then this representation of the input image is passed to a RNN to generate the matching text.</span></div>

<strong>Accuracy:</strong> Fraction of samples that were classified correctly.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>With unbalanced class distributions, e.g., in this case a lot more samples from the blue compared to the red class, the accuracy of a model that simply always predicts the most frequent class can be quite large. But while a 90% accuracy might sound impressive when you report the performance of a model to your project&#8217;s stakeholders, this doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the model is actually useful, especially since in real world problems the undersampled class is often the one we care about most (e.g., people with a rare disease or products that have a defect).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, the balanced accuracy is often the more informative measure when evaluating classification models and can help us to distinguish between a model that has actually learned something and the stupid baseline:<br>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this does not ensure that the model has actually learned any true causal relationship between inputs and outputs and can extrapolate beyond the training domain (we&#8217;ll get to this part in the next section), at least we can be reasonably sure that it will generate reliable predictions for data points similar to those used for training the model. If this isn&#8217;t given, the model is not only wrong, it&#8217;s also useless.</p>

<div class="title"><span class="small">If you were to only look at the test errors for the different models shown here, you might conclude that the model on the left (overfitting) and the one on the right (underfitting) were equally wrong. While this is true in some sense, the test error alone does not tell you <em>why</em> the models are wrong (or how you could improve their performance). As you can see, the two models make mistakes on the test set for completely different reasons: the model that overfits, memorized the training samples and is not able to generalize to new data points, while the model that underfits is too simple to capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs in general. Since these two scenarios require vastly different approaches to improve the model&#8217;s performance, it is important to look at the error on the training set in addition to the error on the test set to determine whether the model&#8217;s errors on the test set are due to over- or underfitting.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since most datasets have lots of input variables, you can&#8217;t just plot the model like we did above to see if it is over- or underfitting, but instead you should check the error that is computed (with a meaningful evaluation metric) on both the training and the test set:</p>
</div>

<strong>Underfitting:</strong> poor training AND test performance</p>

<p>Depending on whether a model over- or underfits, there are different things that can be done to improve its performance. However, it is unrealistic to expect a model to have a perfect performance, as some tasks are just hard, for example, because the data is very noisy.</p>

<p><strong>A correct prediction is not always made for the right reasons!</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The graphic below is taken from a paper where the authors noticed that a fairly simple ML model trained on a standard image classification dataset was performing poorly for all 10 classes in the dataset except one, horses. When they examined the dataset more closely and analyzed <em>why</em> the model predicted a certain class, i.e., which image features were used in the prediction (displayed as the heatmap on the right), they noticed that most of the pictures of horses in the dataset were taken by the same photographer and they all had a characteristic copyright notice in the lower left corner:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By relying on this artifact, the model could identify what it perceived as &#8220;horses&#8221; in this dataset with high accuracy (both in the training and the test set, which also included pictures from the same photographer). However, of course the model had failed to learn what actually defines a horse and it would not be able to extrapolate and achieve the same accuracy on other images without this copyright notice or, equally problematic, might mistakenly classify new images of other objects or animals with a similar copyright notice as horses, too. (Purposefully tricking the model by augmenting other images with such a copyright notice would be an example of an adversarial attack, as discussed below.)</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is by far not the only example where a model has &#8220;cheated&#8221; by exploiting correlations in the training set that resulted in a seemingly good predictive performance, but meant that the model did not pick up on the true causal relationship between the features and labels (e.g., another example would be a dataset with images of dogs and wolves, where all wolves were photographed on snowy backgrounds and the dogs on grass or other non-white backgrounds).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To catch these kinds of mishaps, it is important to <strong>interpret the model and explain its predictions</strong> to see if it has focused on the features you (or a domain expert) would have expected (as they did in the paper above).</p>

<p><strong>Adversarial Attacks: Fooling ML models on purpose</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An adversarial attack on an ML model is performed by asking the model to make a prediction for an input that was modified in such a way that a human is unaware of the change and would still arrive at a correct result, but the ML model changes its prediction to something else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, while an ML model can easily recognize the &#8216;Stop&#8217; sign from the image on the left, the sign on the right is mistaken as a speed limit sign due to the strategically placed, innocent looking stickers, which humans would just ignore:</p>

<p>This happened because the model didn&#8217;t pick up on the true reasons humans identify a Stop sign as such (e.g., octagonal form and 4 white letters spelling &#8216;STOP&#8217; on a red background), but instead relied on some less meaningful correlations to distinguish it from other traffic signs.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since convolutional neural networks (CNN), the type of neural net typically used for image classification tasks, rely a lot on local patterns, they are often easily <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/turtle-or-rifle-hackers-easily-fool-ais-seeing-wrong-thing" target="\_blank">fooled</a> by leaving the global shape of objects in images intact (what humans rely on to identify objects) but overlaying them with specific textures or other high-frequency patterns and thereby causing them to predict a different class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finding robust causal models that capture the true &#8216;input &#8594; output&#8217; relationship in the data is still <a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/2021/03/15/machine-learning-causality/" target="\_blank">an active research area</a> and a lot harder than learning a model that &#8220;only&#8221; generalizes well to the test set.</p>

<p>It is not only important to think about what the true causal relations between variables might be, but also if there could be some causal relationships encoded in the historic data that you <em>don&#8217;t</em> want a model to pick up on. For example, if you know that in the past there was some gender or race discrimination going on that might have leaked into your training data, e.g., white men getting systematically lower interest rates on credits that can not solely be explained by their higher incomes, you might want to take some extra measures to make sure that these relations, although they might have been true causal relationships in the past, are not present in your model now.</p>

Subsequently, these models mistake, e.g., bars of soap found in a poorer country as food (e.g., one could argue that it does indeed bear some resemblance to a plate of food that might be found in a fancy restaurant).</span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, you should always be very careful when including variables in the model that encode attributes such as gender or race. For example, the performance of a model that diagnoses heart attacks will most likely be improved by including &#8216;gender&#8217; as a feature, since men and women present different symptoms when they have a heart attack. On the other hand, a model that assigns someone a credit score should probably not rely on the gender of the person for this decision, since, even though this might have been the case in the historic data because the humans that generated the data relied on their own stereotypes, women should not get a lower score just because they are female.
However, a person&#8217;s gender or race, for example, might also be correlated with other variables such as income or neighborhood, so even features that look innocent at first might still leak problematic information to the model and require some extra steps to ensure the model does not discriminate.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">[Step 1] Start with small pilot projects to understand the potential and challenges of using ML</dt>
<dd>
<p>Machine learning projects are unlike traditional software projects, where you&#8217;re usually pretty certain that a solution at least exists and you only need to figure out an efficient way to get there. Instead, ML heavily relies on the available data and even though it might theoretically be possible to solve your problem with ML, this might not be the case with the data you have at hand.
Before implementing some big AI initiative spanning the whole company, it is therefore strongly recommended that you start with several smaller pilot projects in order to get a better feeling for what it means to rely on an AI to solve your problems.<br>
When choosing a pilot project, the most important factor is not the Return on Investment (ROI) of the project, since here the experience with ML gained along the way should be the priority. However, it is important to choose a project that is <strong>technically feasible</strong> (i.e., for which existing ML algorithms exist and you don&#8217;t need years of research to develop your own fancy neural network architecture) and where you have enough high-quality <strong>data available</strong> to get started (i.e., so you don&#8217;t spend months just on data preprocessing, e.g., due to the need to combine data from different sources within a poor data infrastructure).<br>
If you do not yet have the necessary AI talent in-house to tackle such a project on your own, you can also partner with external consultants, which provide the ML expertise, while you supply the domain knowledge to ensure the pilot project is a success.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve already seen that in practice, it&#8217;s really about the intersection of Theory, Programming, and Domain Knowledge, i.e., Data Science. However, it is unlikely that you&#8217;ll find a single person that is truly competent in all three areas. Instead, people will always have a certain focus and we therefore propose three distinct roles, which also align very well with the three main steps for successfully executing a ML project:</p>

<p>This has several advantages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data scientists can discuss solutions with other ML experts (&#8594; many problems will be similar from an algorithmic standpoint)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine data from the whole company for a holistic analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding independent from individual business unit (necessary for the up front investment in data infrastructure, time required to keep up with new research, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we&#8217;ve discussed in the introduction, about 90% of the time in an ML project is spent on data wrangling. Therefore, especially in the beginning, <strong>the AI team should contain more Data Engineers than Data Scientists</strong>, so they can build a solid data infrastructure, which will save Data Scientists lots of time &amp; headaches later.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">[Step 3] Train other employees to recognize ML problems &amp; establish a data-driven culture</dt>
<dd>
<p>While data scientists need to be intimately familiar with the algorithms they are using, other employees (especially data strategists and department leaders) should have some basic understanding of what ML is (and is not) capable of, such that they can identify possible ML problems and refer them to the AI team.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">[Step 4] Devise a cohesive strategy with long-term goals that result in a competitive advantage</dt>
<dd>
<p>Developing a strategy might be the first impulse of an executive when confronted with a new topic such as AI. However, since AI problems are so different from other kinds of projects, it really pays off to first gain some experience with this topic (i.e., start at step 1!). After you&#8217;ve successfully completed some pilot projects and set the wheels in motion to create an AI team as well as educate the other employees to get them on board (instead of them being afraid than an AI will soon take their job), here are a few things to consider w.r.t. a companywide strategy to give you an advantage over your competition:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create strategic data assets that are hard for your competition to replicate:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Long-term planning: Which data might be valuable in the future? &#8594; Start collecting it now!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up-front investments: What infrastructure &amp; processes are needed to make the data accessible to the right people?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you combine data from different divisions to enable the AI team to &#8220;connect the dots&#8221; and gain a unique edge over the competition?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What options do you have in terms of strategic data acquisition, e.g., in the form of &#8216;free&#8217; products, where users pay with their data (like what Google, Facebook, etc. are doing)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build AI-powered features that are a unique selling point for your products:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to recreate some off-the-shelf service that could be easily procured from an outside vendor, but use ML together with your unique domain knowledge and data to build new features for your existing products to make them more appealing to your customers or open up new market segments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you establish a virtuous cycle, where your AI attracts more users, which in turn generate more data, which can then be used to train the AI to become even better and thereby attracts even more users?</p>

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[Step 5] Communicate your success</dt>
<dd>
<p>After successfully implementing AI within the company, you should of course communicate your accomplishments. In addition to (internal and external) press releases, this also includes, for example, job listings, which will attract more (qualified) candidates if they are formulated from an informed standpoint instead of using a bunch of random buzzwords.</p>
